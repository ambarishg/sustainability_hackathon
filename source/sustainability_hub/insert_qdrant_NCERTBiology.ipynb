In animal tissues, one notices the presence of all such\\n categories of compounds shown in Figure 9.1. These are called primary\\n metabolites. However , when one analyses plant, fungal and microbial cells,\\n one would see thousands of compounds other than these called primary\\n metabolites, e.g. alkaloids, flavonoids, rubber , essential oils, antibiotics,\\n coloured pigments, scents, gums, spices. These\\n are called secondary metabolites  (Table 9.3).\\n While primary metabolites have identifiable\\n functions and play known roles in normal\\n physiologial processes, we do not at the moment,\\n understand the role or functions of all the\\n ‘secondary metabolites’ in host organisms.\\n However , many of them are useful to ‘human\\n welfar e’ (e.g., rubber , drugs, spices, scents and\\n pigments). Some secondary metabolites have\\n ecological importance. In the later chapters and\\n years you will learn more about this.\\n 9.3BIOMACROMOLECULES\\n There is one feature common to all those compounds found in the acid\\n soluble pool. They have molecular weights ranging from 18 to around\\n 800 daltons (Da) approximately.\\n The acid insoluble fraction, has only four types of organic compounds\\n i.e., proteins, nucleic acids, polysaccharides and lipids. These classes of\\n\\nIn summary if we represent the chemical\\n composition of living tissue from abundance point of\\n view and arrange them class-wise, we observe that\\n water is the most abundant chemical in living\\n organisms (Table 9.4).\\n 9.4PROTEINS\\n Proteins are polypeptides. They are linear chains of\\n amino acids linked by peptide bonds as shown in\\n Figure 9.3.\\n Each protein is a polymer of amino acids. As there\\n are 20 types of amino acids (e.g., alanine, cysteine,\\n proline, tryptophan, lysine, etc.), a protein is a\\n heter opolymer and not a homopolymer . A\\n homopolymer has only one type of monomer repeating\\n ‘n’ number of times. This information about the amino\\n acid content is important as later in your nutrition\\n lessons, you will learn that certain amino acids are\\n essential for our health and they have to be supplied\\n through our diet. Hence, dietary proteins are the\\n source of essential amino acids. Therefore, amino acids\\n can be essential or non-essential. The latter are those\\n which our body can make, while we get essential amino\\n acids through our diet/food. Proteins carry out many\\n functions in living organisms, some transport\\n nutrients across cell membrane, some fight infectious\\n organisms, some are hormones, some are enzymes,TABLE 9.5 Some Proteins and their\\n Functions\\n Protein Functions\\n Collagen Intercellular ground\\n substance\\n Trypsin Enzyme\\n Insulin Hormone\\n Antibody Fights infectious agents\\n Receptor Sensory reception\\n (smell, taste, hormone,\\n etc.)\\n GLUT -4 Enables glucose\\n transport\\n into cells\\n Rationalised 2023-24\\n 110 BIOLOGY\\n CH OH2 CH OH2\\n CH2OHOH\\n OH OH\\n OHOO O\\n OO O\\n O\\n O O O OOO\\n Figure 9.2  Diagrammatic representation of a portion of glycogenetc. (Table 9.5).
