Movement is one of the  significant features of living beings. Animals and
plants exhibit a wide range of movements. Streaming of protoplasm in
the unicellular organisms like Amoeba is a simple form of movement.
Movement of cilia, flagella and tentacles are shown by many organisms.
Human beings can move limbs, jaws, eyelids, tongue, etc. Some of the
movements result in a change of place or location. Such voluntary
movements ar e called locomotion . Walking, running, climbing, flying,
swimming are all some forms of locomotory movements. Locomotory
structures need not be different from those affecting other types of
movements. For example, in Paramoecium , cilia helps in the movement of
food through cytopharynx and in locomotion as well. Hydra  can use its
tentacles for capturing its pr ey and also use them for locomotion. W e use
limbs for changes in body postures and locomotion as well. The above
observations suggest that movements and locomotion cannot be studied
separately. The two may be linked by stating that all locomotions are
movements but all movements are not locomotions.
Methods of locomotion performed by animals vary with their habitats
and the demand of the situation. However , locomotion is generally for
search of food, shelter , mate, suitable br
eeding gr ounds, favourable
climatic conditions or to escape from enemies/predators.
