APPENDICES4 Novartis in Society Integrated Report |Oncology and Pharmaceuticals commercial 
organizations and created a new Operations 
organization that combines our manufactur -
ing and services activities. Besides sub -
stantial cost savings, we expect these steps 
to increase our operational agility and 
strengthen our business in key markets 
such as the United States and China.
The organizational changes, which we 
expect to finalize in 2023, complete the 
portfolio shift we started in 2014. Over this 
time, we have divested several non-core 
businesses and spun off our eye-care 
division Alcon. With a view to boosting our 
innovation power, we have also made 
substantial investments in cutting-edge 
technology platforms, including gene 
and cell therapy, radioligand therapy and 
RNA technology.Medical progress and innovation are evolv -
ing with impressive speed even in a world of 
increasing volatility and  uncertainty. In 2022, 
we initiated a major  transformation of our 
organization to further improve our innova -
tion capabilities and align with our growth 
strategy as a pure-play medicines company.
We expect these changes to simplify our 
business, enhance accountabilities and 
strengthen our commercial activities by 
enabling us to better focus on our in-market 
products and high-value pipeline assets. 
Overall, our efforts are set to support our 
long-term sales and profit growth and help 
us create sustainable shareholder value.
As part of this transformation, which includes 
our intention to spin off our Sandoz generics 
and biosimilars Division, we merged our Novartis delivered on its sales and operating 
profit targets in 2022 despite the  challenges 
of a volatile macroeconomic environment 
and while executing on our ongoing trans -
formation, which entailed job reductions due 
to structural changes. This performance 
was supported by cost discipline and 
continued operational streamlining, as well 
as the strong uptake of recently launched 
medicines, such as multiple sclerosis 
treatment Kesimpta , and continued strong 
demand for our cardiovascular medicine 
Entresto  and psoriasis treatment Cosentyx .
Last year also saw new leadership at the 
Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research 
and our Global Drug Development organiza -
tion, the research and development (R&D) 
engines of Novartis, and a renewed focus 
on improving governance and speeding up 
the transition between early drug discovery 
and clinical development. These measures 
should help further strengthen our portfolio 
of medicines, which we have consistently 
broadened in recent years with launches 
including cancer treatments Pluvicto  
and Scemblix . 
We have also further intensified our efforts 
to integrate our environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) activities into our daily 
business, which we believe is vital for the 
success of Novartis. Among a variety of 
steps aimed at reaching as many patients 
as possible, we renewed our commitment to continue our R&D efforts in neglected 
tropical diseases and to work further toward 
the elimination of malaria. In addition, we are 
partnering with the American Society of 
Hematology to deepen our efforts to fight 
against sickle cell disease in Africa.
The Board of Directors also remained 
vigilant in its governance oversight efforts 
by putting added emphasis on values such 
as integrity as Novartis pivots towards 
becoming a high-performance, pure-play 
medicines company. Likewise, the Executive 
Committee and the Board of Directors are 
keeping up the intensive dialogue with stake -
holder groups and working towards achiev -
ing our vision to be the most valued and 
trusted medicines companies in the world.
I thank you for the confidence you have 
placed in our company and am pleased to 
be able to propose a dividend increase of 
3.2% to CHF 3.20 at the next Annual 
 General Meeting.
Sincerely, 
Joerg Reinhardt
Chair of the Board of DirectorsNovartis delivered on 
its sales and operating 
profit targets last year 
despite the challenges 
of a volatile macro -
economic environment 
and while executing on 
our ongoing 
transformation.

APPENDICES5 Novartis in Society Integrated Report |cardiovascular disease, for example, gives 
countries and healthcare systems solutions 
to address the world’s leading cause of 
death and disability. Entresto , our medicine 
for heart failure and hypertension, is esti -
mated to be treating around 10 million 
patients worldwide, while our cholester -
ol-lowering siRNA treatment Leqvio  is now 
approved in 70 countries. 
We saw robust growth momentum across 
our in-market medicines. This includes 
stronger-than-expected uptake in the US for 
Pluvicto , our novel radioligand therapy for 
advanced prostate cancer, highlighting our 
ability to turn the promise of next-generation 
medicines into a reality for patients. 
Despite challenging macroeconomic 
conditions and an unstable geopolitical 
environment, we delivered a solid financial 
performance that underscores the progress 
we are making, with 4% growth in net sales 
in constant currencies (cc) and 8% growth 
(cc) in core operating income compared 
with the previous year. Looking ahead, we 
aim to generate sales growth of 4% CAGR 
over the next five years, and grow above 
peer median beyond 2027. 
Our investments in R&D are key to achieving 
these ambitions. In 2022, we saw a positive 
Phase III readout for iptacopan, which was 
discovered at NIBR, in a rare and deadly 
blood disorder. We saw an important 
positive Phase III result for Pluvicto  in earlier 
lines of prostate cancer. And we also 2022 was a year of transformation for 
Novartis. After more than USD 100 billion in 
acquisitions and divestures over the last 
several years, our structural transformation 
from a diversified healthcare conglomerate 
into a focused, innovative medicines com -
pany will be largely complete after the 
planned spin-off of Sandoz in 2023. 
We also begin 2023 with a simplified 
organizational structure that will spur 
innovation and give us a stronger foundation 
for growth in a rapidly changing global 
business environment.  
While Novartis has pursued bold portfolio 
change, core elements of our company 
remain the same. Our vision is to become 
the most trusted and valued medicines 
company in the world – valued not only for 
our business performance, but also for the 
difference our innovation makes for patients 
and society. 
The world is counting on us to succeed. 
Fewer than 10% of diseases known to affect 
humans are currently treatable, and globally, 
people live an average of 10 years with a 
disease or disability. Yet new treatments 
broadly still reach only a fraction of eligible 
patients, and manageable conditions like 
heart disease cause millions of avoidable 
deaths each year. 
Our performance in 2022 showed that we 
are making progress in addressing society’s 
greatest disease burdens. Our focus on reported positive Phase III results for 
Cosentyx  in hidradenitis suppurativa, 
offering the potential to expand one of our 
most successful medicines and bring a new 
treatment option to patients with this painful 
skin disease.
As we continue innovating for patients, 
millions around the world are still without 
proper access to healthcare. Translating the 
latest science into lasting progress requires 
us to work with healthcare systems and other 
stakeholders to advance access for under -
served patients in low- and middle-income 
countries, while also tackling access 
barriers in some of the wealthiest countries 
in the world. 
In the US, for example, we expanded our 
10-year Beacon of Hope initiative, which 
seeks to address racial disparities in 
healthcare, including by increasing diversity 
among clinical trial participants and investi -
gators. We also pledged to invest USD 250 
million in R&D for the treatment of malaria and neglected tropical diseases, building on 
our decades-long commitment to global 
health priorities. We continue to make 
progress in other aspects of our ESG 
agenda, including reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions from our own operations by 
nearly half since 2016.   
As we look to the future as a focused 
medicines company, our dedication to 
innovation and excellence will drive us 
forward. We have set clear growth ambitions 
and we are confident we will meet them. 
Through reshaping Novartis, we are set to 
reimagine medicine for decades to come. 
Sincerely, 
Vas Narasimhan
Chief Executive OfficerAs we look to the 
future as a focused 
medicines company, 
our dedication to 
innovation and 
excellence will drive 
us forward.

APPENDICES12|Our business environment
Medical technology continues to accelerate, as advanced new treatments emerge to meet the growing 
demand for high-quality healthcare. At the same time, aging populations are putting pressure on 
healthcare resources and access to healthcare remains a challenge around the world. Here are 10 major 
trends currently shaping our business environment.    
Medical science continues  
to accelerateSpending on healthcare 
continues to grow
The need for high-quality health -
care is more critical than ever. 
Globally, people live for an average 
of 10 years with a disease or 
disa bility, and around 1.7 billion 
disability-adjusted life years are 
lost annually to ill-health and early 
death. Over the next five years, 
global spending on medicines is 
forecast to rise faster than GDP 
in many developed countries. The 
price of medicines remains a key 
issue as increased healthcare 
spending and a more uncertain 
economic outlook weigh on 
government budgets. Increased longevity is one of the 
triumphs of modern medicine. 
By 2050, the UN expects there 
will be 1.5 billion people over the 
age of 65, double the current 
number. Aging and lifestyle 
changes are triggering an increase 
in non-communicable diseases 
(NCDs), such as cancer, heart 
disease and diabetes, causing 
millions of preventable deaths 
and putting further pressure on 
healthcare resources.  Aging populations are fueling 
a rise in chronic illness
Scientific innovation is advancing 
at an unprecedented rate. In 
recent years, new types of 
medicines have been approved, 
including RNA therapies, gene 
and cell therapies, and radioligand 
therapies, which offer targeted 
approaches to treating serious 
diseases. Because these 
medicines are complex, they 
require focused investment and 
expertise to bring them to reality 
for patients.Access to healthcare remains 
a formidable challenge
Worldwide, millions of patients 
struggle to access the medicines 
they need. This may be because 
of cost, inequity, or structural 
issues in healthcare systems. 
While access to medicines 
remains an acute issue in lower-
income countries, it is a problem 
in developed countries too, where 
the pandemic highlighted that 
deep health inequities remain 
entrenched. As medical science 
advances so should access 
to medicines.Patients are moving to the 
center of healthcare
Patients are demanding more 
say over their treatment through 
patient representative groups 
and other means. In response, 
healthcare systems and 
pharmaceutical companies are 
moving toward a more integrated, 
end-to-end approach, with an 
increased focus on patient 
engagement in drug development 
and other areas. At the same 
time, patients are becoming 
more important as data owners 
– as personal data enables more 
targeted treatments and supports 
the development of new medicines.
3–6%
Global healthcare spending
Over the next five years, spending 
on medicines globally is forecast to 
rise by 3–6%, growing faster than 
GDP in many developed countries. 
(IQVIA Institute, The Global Use of 
Medicines 2022)76%
Deaths from NCDs
Globally, NCDs accounted for 
75.6% of all deaths in 2019, up 
from 60.8% in 2000.  
(World Health Organization, 
World Health Statistics 2022)10-20
US gene therapy 
 approvals
By 2025, the US Food & Drug 
Administration (FDA) expects to 
be approving 10-20 gene and 
cell therapies annually.  
(FDA statement, 2019)2 bn
People lacking access to 
essential medicines
Five billion people worldwide 
have access to medicines, 
leaving an estimated two billion 
without. (Access to Medicine 
Foundation, 2022)78
Patient organizations
Membership of the European 
Patients’ Forum (EPF), an 
umbrella body of patient 
organizations across Europe, rose 
to 78 in 2022 from 13 in 2003.

APPENDICES13 Novartis in Society Integrated Report |Our business environment (continued)
New technologies are 
reshaping our industryEconomic uncertainty is 
growing, post-pandemic
The global economy is facing 
considerable uncertainty, driven 
by concerns over rising prices and 
geopolitical instability. Forecasts 
suggest the current economic 
slowdown is likely to continue in 
2023. In our own industry, COVID-
19 put strain on supply chains 
and highlighted the importance 
of resilient supplies of active 
pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) 
– the raw materials used to make 
finished medicines. At a time of growing economic 
uncertainty, investors are 
looking for sustainable growth in 
margins and earnings. To remain 
competitive, pharmaceutical 
companies are moving to more 
agile, efficient business models, 
particularly as they invest to build 
specialized capabilities in R&D and 
manufacturing. Meanwhile, rates 
of return on R&D are increasing 
for the first time in several years, 
largely because of emergency 
approvals during the COVID-19 
crisis and faster innovation cycles. Biopharma searches for 
more efficiency
The use of data science and 
technology is increasing across 
our industry in everything from 
R&D to manufacturing and 
marketing. While this has brought 
greater efficiency, it also requires 
new investment and skills. 
Importantly, new technologies are 
helping to close gaps between 
companies, healthcare systems 
and patients – for example, by 
providing insights into the social 
determinants of heart health, which 
are enabling the development of  
new prevention measures. Working practices are 
changing
Working practices are changing 
in many countries. Demand for 
new skills is increasing, especially 
in areas such as data science. 
Workforces are becoming more 
flexible and more diverse. This 
allows companies to tap into new 
talent pools, which is important at 
a time of skills shortages in many 
parts of the economy. Climate change is 
increasingly affecting  
human health
Extreme temperatures and poor 
air quality are changing patterns 
of both infectious diseases and 
NCDs, including malaria and 
respiratory illnesses. Ultimately, 
climate change could undermine 
decades of progress in improving 
human health at a time when 
antimicrobial resistance is also 
rising. At the same time, more 
governments are looking to decar -
bonize their economies over the 
long-term, while companies also 
face increased scrutiny over the 
sustainability of their operations 
and supply chains. 
2.9%
Expected global  
GDP growth
Global GDP growth is forecast 
to slow to 2.9% in 2023. 
Growth in some of the world’s 
most advanced economies is 
expected to be lower.  
(International Monetary 
Fund—World Economic 
Outlook, 2022)45%
Increased spending  
on R&D 
Spending on R&D by large 
pharmaceutical companies 
increased by nearly 45% 
between 2016 and 2021.  
(IQVIA, Global Trends  
in R&D 2022)410 bn
Added value in  
healthcare (USD)
T echnology-driven innovation 
in healthcare could create up to 
USD 410 billion in added value 
every year by 2025.  
(McKinsey, The era 
of  exponential improvement 
in healthcare, 2019)76%
Employees  
valuing diversity
76% of job seekers and  
employees believe that a diverse 
workforce is an important factor 
when evaluating job offers, and 
nearly a third (32%) would not apply 
to a company that lacks diversity. 
(Glassdoor, 2020)250 000
Additional deaths
Between 2030 and 2050, 
climate change is expected to 
cause approximately 250 000 
additional deaths per year due 
to malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea 
and heat stress.  
(WHO, Climate Change  
and Health, 2021)

We are working to reduce the burden of disease for patients 
and society. We discover and develop new medicines, with a 
focus on unmet patient needs across five core therapeutic areas.
” Ethical business practices  q p. 60
Our stakeholders expect us to uphold high ethical standards 
throughout our business, from R&D and manufacturing to 
supply chain management and our commercial operations. 
• People and culture  q p. 48
We have a strong culture based on defined values and 
behaviors. This drives performance and innovation, and  
ensures we attract and retain the talent we need to deliver  
on our purpose.
– Good governance  q p. 62
Good governance is about how we take decisions and allocate 
resources. It supports effective management of our business 
and forms the basis of trust in our company. 
— Sustainable financial performance  q p. 25
Maintaining our financial performance enables us to deliver 
returns to shareholders and invest in areas where we believe 
we can create the most value for stakeholders and society.
˜ Environmental sustainability  q p.44
Environmental sustainability is an essential part of our strategy 
and business model. We aim to limit our impact on the environ -
ment by reducing emissions, waste and consumption of natural 
resources, including water.Every four years, we conduct a detailed assessment to 
identify our material issues. Results from this assessment 
inform our strategy and ESG reporting. The assessment sits 
alongside our regular risk analysis (see page 68 ).
Our latest assessment, conducted in 2021, was based 
on a survey of more than 500 external and 12 000 internal 
stakeholders. Respondents were asked to rank the 
impact of Novartis across eight impact clusters. Follow-up 
 interviews were conducted with 140 respondents. The 
results of this exercise can be seen in the chart on the right.
External stakeholders were drawn from our main stake -
holder groups, including patients, customers, partners  
and shareholders. Internal stakeholders, including senior 
management, were drawn from across business divisions 
and functions.
Overall, these results were in line with the previous assess -
ment carried out in 2017 and were consistent across 
stake  holder groups. Patient safety, access to healthcare, 
innovation and ethical business practices also ranked highly 
in our previous survey.Ranking of impact clusters

Our strategy as a focused 
medicines company is to deliver 
high-value medicines that 
alleviate society’s greatest 
disease burdens through 
technology leadership in R&D  
and novel access approaches. 
We have made significant progress in 
transforming Novartis from a diversified 
healthcare conglomerate into a focused 
medicines company. In doing so, we have 
divested or spun off non-core businesses 
and made targeted acquisitions to focus on 
our core business: discovering and develop -
ing new medicines and finding new ways to 
deliver them to as many people as possible. 
In 2022, we continued to execute on our 
strategy by putting in place a new organiza -
tional structure to support innovation, 
growth and productivity. We also updated 
our strategic priorities and announced our 
intention to spin off our Sandoz Division, 
which paves the way for Novartis to 
advance as a company focused fully on 
innovative medicines. Our focus areas determine where 
we invest most of our time, energy 
and resources.
Core therapeutic areas  with high 
unmet patient needs: cardiovascular; 
immunology; neuroscience; solid 
tumors; and hematology. 
Technology platforms where we 
have the depth and scale to discover, 
develop and commercialize new 
therapies: chemistry; biotherapeutics; 
RNA therapy; radioligand therapy; and 
gene and cell therapy. 
Priority geographies that together 
account for the majority of expected 
growth in global healthcare spending: 
US, Germany, China and Japan. We 
aim to be a top-five player in the US 
by 2027. While these are our priority 
countries, we maintain a continued 
presence in other markets worldwide. Our focus areas are supported by our 
 strategic priorities, which determine  
how we implement our strategy.

APPENDICES18 Novartis in Society Integrated Report |Transforming and focusing our company
We have evolved from being a diversified healthcare conglomerate 
to a focused, innovative medicines company. Announced in April 
2022, our new organizational structure aligns the way we operate 
with this strategy.
The changes – part of our Transforming for Growth initiative – are 
designed to power our next phase of innovation, growth and 
productivity. We aim to drive shareholder returns by sharpening our 
focus on our core business, becoming more agile and efficient, and 
creating the conditions for growth in our priority markets. The new 
structure became fully operational in January 2023. Please see 
page 42  for further details.
In August 2022, we also announced plans to spin off 100% of our 
Sandoz Division, which we expect to be complete by the second 
half of 2023. The spin-off will create Europe’s leading producer of 
generics and a global leader in biosimilars and allow us to concen -
trate fully on our core business. Spinning off Sandoz is in the best 
interests of our shareholders as it would create two standalone 
companies focused on their respective growth strategies. 
Completion of the transaction is subject to certain conditions, 
including consultation with works councils and employee represen -
tatives (as required), general market conditions, tax rulings and 
opinions, final Board of Directors endorsement and shareholder 
approval in line with Swiss corporate law. The transaction is 
expected to be tax neutral to Novartis.2023

Novartis has a longstanding commitment to respect and understand the 
perspective of patients throughout our business to ensure we meet their 
most critical needs.
Research shows that effective patient engagement leads to faster 
enrolment in clinical trials, increased patient retention and more efficient 
trial design – helping to streamline R&D and bring medicines to patients 
faster. Embedding patient insights into our commercial activities also leads 
to more successful launches and better patient adherence to treatments. 
We have developed a five-point framework (see infographic below) 
to gather input – from early research through to post-launch – and we 
are making progress in consistently and systematically embedding 
patient insights into these key milestones. For example, in 2022 we 
obtained patient input in 87% of our early research programs and 37% 
of our clinical development programs (compared with 84% and 30%, 
respectively, in 2021).
The broader industry is also moving to a more patient-centric model of 
healthcare, as companies and healthcare systems recognize the benefits 
of patient engagement and patients demand a greater say in their 
treatment. Healthcare regulators in the US, Europe and other countries 
recently issued guidelines on patient engagement, including recommen-
dations on co-designing clinical trial endpoints with patients. See page 37 
for more information on our approach to clinical trials.87%

 Our business positively impacts society in 
various ways. By delivering high-value 
medicines, for example, we improve and 
extend people’s lives. At the same time, our 
activities may have negative effects, which 
is why we strive to reduce our environmen -
tal footprint, uphold safety standards and 
protect human rights in our value chain.
Novartis supports the development of 
emerging methodologies and standards to 
measure the impact of companies on 
society and the environment. We focus on 
two areas: impact valuation and assessing 
our contribution to the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs).
SDGs
In 2022, we took part in a pilot project with 
the United Nations Environment Program 
Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) to assess our 
activities against social and environmental 
impact areas. 
The analysis is based on our industry 
sector as well as information about our 
main countries by sales, production and 
supplier spend. It uses country-level proxy 
data to identify potential positive and 
negative impact areas that connect to the 
SDGs. We publish the results for informa -
tion purposes only.
The results show a significant positive 
association with “health and sanitation” 
– which connects to SDG 3 – through the 
impact of our medicines on human health. 
UNEP FI defines a significant impact area as one where there is a strong correlation 
with a company’s business, its sector and the 
countries in which it operates. Please see 
page 34  for further information about our 
contribution to SDG3. The analysis also 
showed a moderate positive impact on 
employment and the economy due to wages, 
benefits and employee development. 
As a company with a global manufacturing 
network and supply chain, we have a poten -
tial moderate negative impact on natural 
resources including climate, air and water.  
We also have a potential moderate negative 
impact on employment due to risks associ -
ated with occupational safety. Minimizing our 
impact on the environment and ensuring a 
safe working environment are key parts of 
our strategy and operating model. See 
pages 46  and 51  for more details.
Impact valuation
Novartis is a founding member of the Value 
Balancing Alliance (VBA), a non-profit organi -
zation that aims to create a standard for mea- 
 suring the value companies provide to society.
Based on VBA methodology, we are pio -
neering an approach called social, environ -
mental and economic (SEE) impact valua -
tion, which aims to show the positive impact 
we bring to countries, health systems and 
individuals, balanced by the negative impact 
of our operations on the environment and 
other areas. Expressing these impacts in 
monetary terms makes them transparent 
and comparable. Please see our corporate 
website for more information.Measuring our impact
Our impact on the SDGs
Bold text in the infographic denotes areas of impact for Novartis. Our significant potential 
positive impact is on SDG 3 (good health and well-being). Note that impact areas and 
their connection to the SDGs are defined by UNEP FI.

by increased sales of key products 
across our core therapeutic areas.
Group performance
Novartis full-year net sales were USD 50.5 
billion, up 4% from the prior year when 
measured in constant currencies (cc) to 
remove the impact of exchange rate move -
ments, but down 2% when measured in US 
dollar terms. 
Increased sales of key products across our 
core therapeutic areas continued to under -
pin our financial performance.
Sales of our heart failure medicine Entresto  
grew 37% (cc) to USD 4.6 billion, driven by 
sustained growth and increased patient 
share across all geographies. Sales of our 
cholesterol  -lowering treatment Leqvio  
reached USD 112 million following launch in 
the US and other countries during 2022.  
Cosentyx , our treatment for psoriasis and 
other autoimmune diseases, also continued 
to grow. Sales rose 5% (cc) from the prior 
year to USD 4.8 billion, driven primarily by 
continued volume growth across key markets. Kesimpta , a treatment for relapsing multiple 
sclerosis, reached blockbuster status for 
the first time, with sales growth driven by 
launch momentum across all geographies. It 
registered sales of USD 1.1 billion, up 200% 
(cc) from the prior year. 
Kisqali , a treatment for breast cancer, also 
reached blockbuster status for the first time 
with sales growth of 38% (cc) to USD 1.2 
billion, driven by double-digit growth across 
all regions. Jakavi , a treatment for blood 
disorders and cancers, grew 9% (cc) to 
USD 1.6 billion.

+4%Operating income was USD 9.2 billion, down 
13% (cc) from the prior year, mainly due to 
higher restructuring costs related to the 
implementation of our new organizational 
model and higher impairments.
Net income was USD 7.0 billion, compared 
with USD 24.0 billion in the prior year, mainly 
due to the divestment of our stake in Roche 
in the prior year. Excluding the Roche 
impact, net income declined by 9% (cc), 
mainly due to lower operating income. 
Earnings per share were USD 3.19 compared 
with USD 10.71 in the prior year. Excluding 
the Roche impact, EPS declined by 7% (cc).
To help people understand our underlying 
performance, we also present our core 
results, which exclude the impact of amorti -
zation, restructurings, acquisitions and other 
significant items. Core operating income of 
USD 16.7 billion rose 8% (cc). Core net income 
of USD 13.4 billion rose 3% (cc). Core earn -
ings per share were USD 6.12, up 6% (cc). 
Free cash flow of USD 11.9 billion was down 
10%, mainly due to a decrease in net cash 
flows from operating activities and lower 
divestment proceeds, partly offset by lower 
purchases of property, plant and equipment.Innovative Medicines
Our Innovative Medicines Division focuses 
on our five core therapeutic areas, as well 
as other promoted brands (in the therapeutic 
areas of ophthalmology and respiratory) and 
established brands.
The IM Division delivered net sales of USD 
41.3 billion in 2022, an increase of 4% (cc)

APPENDICES30|Deliver high-value medicines
RNA therapies, gene and cell therapies, and 
radioligand therapies that offer targeted 
approaches to treating serious diseases. 
In 2022, Novartis continued to deliver high- 
value medicines to patients. We received 
23 approvals in the US, EU, China and Japan, 
including a novel radioligand therapy for 
advanced prostate cancer in the US and EU. 
We advanced our focused pipeline of investi -
gational medicines, with several clinical data 
readouts paving the way for further launches 
in 2023 and beyond.
However, we also had disappointments as 
some clinical trials of investigational com -
pounds – including ACZ885 (canakinumab) 
for lung cancer and UNR844 for presbyopia 
– did not meet their primary goals.
Bringing our medicines to patients
We focus on high-value innovative medicines 
with the potential to transform the treatment 
of diseases across our five core therapeutic 
areas where we have a leadership position and 
where there are high unmet patient needs. 
To do this, we seek to maximize the value of 
our key in-market and launch medicines, 
while investing in R&D over the longer term 
to deliver the next generation of therapies 
for patients. We follow an integrated, 
end-to-end approach across the drug 
development continuum – from early 
research through development, launch and patient access – with close collaboration 
between our R&D, manufacturing and 
commercial teams to broaden the reach and 
impact of our medicines.
We also focus our activities on key markets 
that represent the majority of the expected 
growth in healthcare spending over the next 
several years. Foremost among these is the 
US, the world’s largest healthcare market, 
where we aim to be a top-five player by 2027.
Across our key products and markets, we 
pursue effective life-cycle management and 
launch excellence to maximize the commer -
cial potential of our medicines and broaden 
access for patients in line with the Novartis 
Access Principles (see page 54 ). This 
involves investing earlier in pre-launch 
preparation and working systematically to Millions of people around the 
world live with serious diseases 
that cause early death and disability 
and place an enormous burden 
on healthcare systems. At Novartis, 
we are dedicated to discovering 
and developing new treatments 
for diseases including cancer, 
heart disease and neurological 
conditions – and delivering them 
at scale to reach as many patients 
as possible. 
Delivering new medicines is at the core of 
our purpose and value creation as a com -
pany: we are in the business of improving 
and extending people’s lives and helping 
governments shape healthier societies. 
Improving human health is more critical than 
ever. Globally, people live for an average of 
10 years with a disease or disability. Chronic 
conditions make up an increasing share of 
the disease burden as populations age, with 
cardiovascular disease and cancer together 
responsible for 28 million deaths annually. 
We use a variety of scientific tools to meet 
this challenge. Medical science is advancing

CVD drives health 
disparities
According to the American 
Heart Association, heart 
disease accounts for nearly 
40% of the disparity in life 
expectancy between Black 
and white Americans.Addressing the factors behind heart  
disease in the US
Almost a quarter of deaths in the US are due to cardiovascular 
disease. Social factors such as living conditions, education and 
diet play a key role in determining a person’s heart health.  
These risk factors are exacerbated by racial inequity: according 
to the American Heart Association, heart disease accounts for 
nearly 40% of the disparity in life expectancy between Black  
and white Americans. 
Our three-year Closing the Gap initiative with Thomas Jefferson 
University and Jefferson Health focuses on addressing the social 
determinants of heart health in five vulnerable neighborhoods 
in Philadelphia with high rates of stroke and adverse outcomes 
related to heart disease. The aim is to reduce the impact of 
undertreated and untreated heart disease risk factors by creating 
systems of change in these communities that enable people to live 
healthier lives and experience better connections to health systems. 
Closing the Gap enables us to take an upstream approach. 
Dedicated clinical personnel and community health workers 
conduct screenings and connect people with resources such as 
food, health, education or housing assistance. Assistance is also 
provided to help people reduce health risks related to diabetes 
and hypertension, and connect them to trusted sources of care.Nancy Porroa, a  
community health worker in 
Philadelphia, checks the blood 
pressure of a local resident Our cholesterol-lowering treatment Leqvio  
has now been approved for use in 70 
countries worldwide. Leqvio  is a subcutane -
ous injection given by a healthcare provider 
every six months (after an initial dose and 
one at three months). In conjunction with a 
healthy diet and statins, Leqvio  may help 
those who have difficulty sticking to medi -
cines that are self-administered and have 
greater dosing frequency.
The launch of Leqvio  in the US and other 
markets is ongoing, with a focus on patient 
on-boarding, removing access hurdles and 
enhancing medical education. In the US, we 
continue to see steady progress in expand -
ing access to Leqvio . After securing cover -
age from key payers, the medicine is cov -
ered at or near label for 76% of patients 
around one year after launch. In addition, 
67% of patients pay out-of-pocket expense 
of less than USD 10. 
We are advancing our partnership with the 
National Health Service (NHS) in England 
focused on people who have had a cardio -
vascular event and have high LDL choles -
terol. The aim is to help doctors to identify 
and treat 300 000 people over three years. 
In 2022, as part of our collaboration, we 
secured access for Leqvio  in nearly all local 
care formularies, developed tools to more 
easily identify patients not being optimized, 
and helped the NHS improve overall choles -
terol management in primary care.  In each of our core therapeutic areas, we 
have key products that together we expect 
to contribute more than two-thirds of our 
growth in the next five years.
Á
Cardiovascular
Key products: Entresto , Leqvio
Cardiovascular disease (CVD), which 
includes chronic conditions affecting the 
heart and blood vessels such as heart 
failure, heart attacks and strokes, is the 
world’s leading cause of death and one of 
society’s biggest health concerns. More 
people die every year from heart attacks 
and strokes than died from COVID-19 during 
the recent pandemic. Many of these deaths 
are preventable through management of risk 
factors including high cholesterol. The total 
global cost of CVD is set to rise to more than 
USD 1 trillion by 2030.
Our cardiovascular portfolio comprises 
therapies to treat heart failure and reduce 
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol 
(also known as ‘bad cholesterol’), a key 
contributor to the build-up of fat deposits in 
arteries (atherosclerosis). We are also 
working systematically to meet the needs of 
health systems and patients through innova -
tive access approaches, such as population 
health agreements, that work in tandem with 
our medicines to reduce the impact of CVD 
equitably and at scale.

guidelines issued by the American Heart 
Association, American College of Cardiology 
and Heart Failure Society of America, Entresto

Immunology
Key product: Cosentyx
Immunology covers a broad spectrum of 
conditions, including chronic skin diseases 
such as psoriasis. Immunological diseases 
affect an estimated 4.5% of the world’s 
population, and their prevalence is increasing.
In 2022, we saw continued growth for 
Cosentyx , our treatment for several systemic 
inflammatory conditions, due to approvals 
for new indications in key markets and 
initiatives to expand patient access. Since 
initial approval in 2015, Cosentyx  has treated 
more than 960 000 patients worldwide.
In the EU, Cosentyx  received approval for 
active enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) and 
active juvenile psoriatic arthritis (JPsA) in children aged six years and over, following 
US approval in 2021. ERA and JPsA are 
subtypes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis that, 
if left untreated, can lead to high levels of 
pain and disability.
In China, Cosentyx  maintained a strong 
growth trajectory as we continued to expand 
hospital access for continued patient uptake. 
Based on internal Novartis estimates, 
Cosentyx  is now available in approximately 
1 900 hospitals in China and has been used to 
treat around 250 000 psoriasis and ankylos -
ing spondylitis patients since approval in 2019.
We also reported Phase III results for 
Cosentyx  in hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), 
a painful and recurrent skin disease that 
affects around one in 100 people. The data 
showed HS patients treated with Cosentyx  
experienced rapid and long-lasting symp -
tom relief, with favorable safety consistent 
with the medicine’s well-established profile. 
Data from these trials has been submitted 
to regulatory authorities in Europe and 
the US and other countries, with the goal 
of bringing Cosentyx  as a new treatment 
option to patients as soon as possible.

Neuroscience
Key products: Kesimpta , Zolgensma
Around 2 million people worldwide suffer 
from multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune 
disease that is the most common cause of neurological disability unrelated to trauma in 
people under 40 years of age.
Kesimpta , our treatment for relapsing forms 
of MS, which has been shown to reduce the 
risk of worsening disability from MS for up 
to four years, has now been approved in 
80 countries with more than 36 000 patients 
treated. Kesimpta  has seen strong launch 
uptake in the US, Japan and Europe. In 
Europe, it saw additional launches in Italy 
and Spain during 2022, and reached 10 000 
active patients by the end of the year.
New data in 2022 showed that earlier 
treatment with Kesimpta  is more effective 
in limiting the progression and impact of 
MS compared with treatment at a later 
stage – helping to reduce the burden of the 
disease for patients and healthcare systems. 
Kesimpta  is a once-monthly injectable 
treatment that can be taken from home, 
which helps broaden access for patients who 
have difficulty visiting healthcare facilities.
Zolgensma , a one-time, intravenous gene 
replacement therapy for spinal muscular 
atrophy (SMA), has now launched in most 
major markets. SMA is a rare genetic 
neuromuscular disease that results in the 
progressive and irreversible loss of motor 
neurons, which causes muscle weakness 
and atrophy. Zolgensma  has been approved 
for use in 45 countries. In 2022, South 
Korea and Poland agreed to reimburse 
patients for the therapy. So far, more than 
2 500 patients have used Zolgensma  across clinical trials, access programs and in the 
commercial setting. 
New data in 2022 also reinforced the trans -
formational benefit of Zolgensma , demon -
strating age-appropriate development when 
used pre-symptomatically, and maintenance 
of the ability to speak, swallow and meet 
nutritional needs when used symptomatically.

Cancer is the second leading cause of death 
worldwide, and is a growing health issue in 
LMICs. The WHO estimates there will be 
50% more new cancer cases in 2040 than 
there are today. 
Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent 
types of cancer. Kisqali , our medicine for 
HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer, the 
most common subtype of breast cancer, 
has now been approved for use in more than 
95 countries and has been used to treat 
more than 60 000 patients. Kisqali , which 
inhibits two enzymes involved in the control 
of cell cycle progression known as CDK4 and 
CDK6, continues to show strong growth due 
to the increasing recognition of its impact on 
overall survival and quality of life benefits in 
the advanced breast cancer setting. In early 
2023, it was approved in China for premeno -
pausal and perimenopausal women with 
advanced breast cancer.

APPENDICES33 Novartis in Society Integrated Report |Working to eliminate malaria and neglected  
tropical diseases
UN Sustainable Development Goal 3 is about good health and 
well-being. At Novartis, we have been working for decades to find 
new treatments for some of the world’s biggest healthcare 
challenges – from noncommunicable diseases like cancer and 
cardiovascular disease to infectious diseases such as malaria.
One of the targets to support SDG 3 is to end the epidemics of 
malaria and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Every year, NTDs 
trap millions of people in a cycle of poverty and illness. 
In June, we endorsed the Kigali Declaration on Neglected Tropical 
Diseases and pledged USD 250 million over five years (2021-
2025) to advance new treatments for NTDs and malaria. This 
commitment includes the development of next-generation 
antimalarials, including an optimized formulation for infants, as 
well as further research into Chagas disease, dengue, leishmania-
sis and cryptosporidiosis, a parasitic infection that causes 
life-threatening diarrhea in malnourished children.T arget 3.3 reads: By 2030, end 
the epidemics of AIDS, 
tuberculosis, malaria and 
neglected tropical diseases 
and combat hepatitis, 
water-borne diseases and 
other communicable diseases.

hope for many patients is to live as long and 
as well as possible. In 2022, Kisqali  data 
continued to demonstrate an overall survival 
benefit while maintaining or improving 
quality of life for people living with HR+/
HER2- advanced breast cancer, which has 
now been observed across all three Phase 
III clinical trials. A Phase III study of Kisqali  in 
early-stage breast cancer – the biggest-ever 
clinical study of a CDK4/6 inhibitor for this 
disease – is ongoing.
During the year, we also secured approval 
in the US, EU and other countries for Pluvicto , 
our radioligand therapy for progressive 
metastatic castration-resistant prostate 
cancer (mCRPC), an advanced form of 
prostate cancer that currently has few 
treatment options. Prostate cancer is among 
the most frequently diagnosed cancers in 
men and causes more than 30 000 deaths in 
the US every year. Since launch, we have been 
working to scale up production of Pluvicto  to 
meet higher-than-expected demand. 
In December, we announced positive early 
results from a second, pivotal Phase III  
study of Pluvicto  in mCRPC patients prior  
to receiving a taxane-based chemotherapy.  
An additional Phase III trial in an earlier

65. Significant advances in recent years 
have led to improved survival rates, enabling 
more patients to live with the disease. Even 
so, many patients remain at risk of disease 
progression, and are resistant to, or intoler -
ant of, most available treatments.

APPENDICES34|‘T wo plus three’– our key technology platforms
Chemistry Biotherapeutics Radioligand therapy RNA therapy Gene & cell therapy
Chemistry is the discovery of low 
molecular weight synthetic 
molecules that can be optimized  
as medicines. Biotherapeutics, or biologics, are 
medicines derived from the 
molecules of life, carefully 
engineered to treat specific 
diseases.RNA therapies use various forms of 
ribonucleic acids (RNA) to modify 
biological pathways in the body to 
treat or cure specific illnesses.Radioligand therapy delivers  
precision-targeted radiation  
to cancer cells in the body with  
the goal of limiting damage to 
surrounding tissue.Gene therapies modify part of  
a patient’s genetic makeup to  
help treat genetic or inherited 
diseases. Cell therapies treat 
diseases by restoring or altering 
certain sets of cells or by using cells 
to carry a therapy through the body.Research and development 
As with our commercial strategy, we have 
clear priorities in R&D to maximize the value 
of our pipeline of investigational medicines. 
From the inception of a potential therapeutic 
through to clinical development and launch, 
our teams collaborate in support of our 
purpose to improve and extend people’s 
lives. Researchers at the Novartis Institutes 
for BioMedical Research (NIBR)  work 
across several therapeutic areas to uncover 
biological insights into the origins and 
pathogenesis of disease to drive the discov -
ery and development of the next generation 
of medicines. Our Global Drug Development 
(GDD)  organization leads the advanced 
clinical development of potential new 
medicines, running large clinical trials and 
steering the way to regulatory approval and 
access for patients.
This work is powered by technology 
 platforms that help us to discover, develop 
and commercialize new therapies across 
our therapeutic areas. We focus on two established platforms – chemistry and 
biotherapeutics – plus three advanced 
platforms – RNA, radioligand therapy, and 
gene and cell therapy – that offer targeted 
approaches to treating disease. We are 
investing to build our capabilities in these 
advanced platforms and expect them to 
play an increasingly important role in 
developing new medicines in the future.
Within this ‘two plus three’ approach, we 
focus our development resources on our 
priority assets to maximize high potential 
early programs and ensure flawless execu -
tion of late-stage pipeline programs, in 
addition to supporting lifecycle management 
by growing the evidence base for key 
in-market assets.
We continue to make significant invest -
ments to support our R&D strategy. In 2022, 
we invested USD 10.0 billion in R&D, com -
pared with USD 9.5 billion in the prior year. 
Approximately 21 000 Novartis employees 
work in R&D – around one fifth of our 
total workforce.Delivering high-value medicines requires a 
focus on productivity and prioritization to 
increase our returns on R&D investment 
– for example by moving quickly to expand 
projects with high potential and stop or 
out-license non-core programs. At the same 
time, we are using AI to optimize drug 
discovery and development, and reduce 
cycle times (see page 52 ).
While most of our research is conducted 
internally, we increase our chances of 
discovering new medicines by collaborating 
with outside researchers and biotech 
companies. Our network consists of more 
than 300 outside academics and 100 
industry alliances working on joint research 
and drug discovery. 
Significant pipeline advancements in 2022 
include the approval of novel radioligand 
therapy Pluvicto , and further approvals and 
indication expansions for Scemblix , Kymriah  
and Cosentyx . We also presented several 
late-stage data readouts that pave the way 
for further launches in 2023 and beyond. For example, our complement factor B 
inhibitor iptacopan (LNP023) met its primary 
endpoints in two Phase III studies in patients 
with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria 
(PNH), a rare and deadly blood disorder. Global 
regulatory submissions for iptacopan for the 
treatment of PNH are anticipated to be filed in 
2023. If approved, iptacopan has the potential 
to become the first oral monotherapy for PNH.
Iptacopan was discovered at NIBR through 
research targeting the immune system’s 
alternative complement pathway, of which 
complement factor B is a key part. When it’s 
working properly, this pathway helps clear the 
body of pathogens and damaged cells. When 
it’s not, it can cause the destruction of critical 
cells in the body, leading to a variety of debili -
tating diseases.
Iptacopan is also being studied for other 
indications such as kidney diseases and other 
rare blood disorders. Its potential as an oral 
treatment for several complement-  mediated 
diseases was recognized early, prompting the 
design of a streamlined, parallel development 
plan in multiple patient populations.

APPENDICES35 Novartis in Society Integrated Report |Creating new possibilities in cancer care
Cancer is a spectrum of diseases with diverse characteristics that share 
a common feature – abnormal cells that grow out of control. Novartis has 
developed a world-class portfolio of compounds and biotherapeutics  
that inhibit key pathways driving cell survival and growth in a number of 
cancers. While tremendous progress has been made, an urgent need for 
new and better treatments remains. We are pursuing technologies that 
hold the potential for more diverse, targeted therapeutics to treat 
additional forms of cancer.
Novartis scientists are working to make CAR-T therapy, a treatment for 
certain blood cancers that sits at the intersection of cell-, gene-, and 
immuno-based therapies, better and more effective. The technology, 
known as T-Charge, shortens the time it takes to genetically engineer  
T cells during the CAR-T manufacturing process, so they can be given 
back to patients faster. T-Charge also helps these cells persist in patients 
longer, with the goal of giving them a better chance to control cancer. We 
are studying T-Charge in clinical trials to gauge its potential efficacy.
Radioligand therapy uses radiation to destroy cancer cells in a more 
targeted way than conventional radiotherapy. By using special molecules 
that carry a therapeutic radioisotope and circulate throughout the 
bloodstream, this technology can target cancer cells anywhere in the 
body while limiting damage to surrounding cells. Radioligand therapy is 
used for certain neuroendocrine tumors and advanced stages of prostate 
cancer. Novartis scientists are working to apply it to other cancer types.
Finally, targeted protein degradation takes advantage of the protea-
some, a cell’s internal machinery for eliminating unwanted proteins. With 
this technology, scientists will potentially be able remove proteins from 
the cell, rather than just blocking their activity – opening the way to 
develop targeted therapies for cancer-causing proteins that have long 
eluded drug hunters.50%
More cancer cases
The WHO estimates there will be 
50% more new cancer cases in 
2040 than there are today.

Implement a global access strategy for all new 
medicines launchedAll new launches in 2022 had a global access 
strategy.
Innovation for global health
In 2022, we also advanced our efforts to 
develop novel medicines for diseases that 
predominantly affect underserved patients 
in LMICs. For example, we announced we 
will progress ganaplacide/lumefantrine 
(KAF156) into Phase III development for the 
treatment of patients with acute uncompli -
cated malaria.
Ganaplacide is a novel agent with a new 
mechanism of action and is active against 
malaria parasites that are partially resistant 
to existing antimalarials. Combined with a 
once-daily formulation of lumefantrine, this 
combination has the potential not only to 
clear malaria infection, but also to block the 
transmission of the malaria parasite. 
The Phase III trial is planned to start in 2023 
and will include clinical sites in sub-Saharan 
Africa. Ganaplacide/lumefantrine is being 
developed with support from the Medicines 
for Malaria Venture and their partners.Our approach to clinical trials  
Clinical trials play a critical role in delivering 
high-value medicines: they help determine 
whether our investigational medicines  
are effective and safe before they are 
approved by regulatory authorities for 
general use in patients.
For every clinical trial our primary responsibil -
ity is to protect the safety, well-being and legal 
rights of all participants and ensure adher -
ence to the highest ethical standards for 
clinical research. For more information, see 
our position on responsible clinical trials .
As part of the Novartis Commitment to 
Patients and Caregivers,  we are committed 
to seeking patient input into the design of 
our clinical trials, helping us to develop 
medicines that address patient needs. We 
are also committed to registering new 
medicines in every country where patients 
have taken part in clinical trials and to 
publishing the results.  See page 22  for 
more information on patient engagement. Diversity in clinical trials
Diverse representation in clinical trials helps 
us understand how patient groups who are 
most likely to be treated for a disease will 
respond to a medicine – ultimately improving 
the quality of care for every patient, while 
also helping to address health inequities in 
society. In the US, for example, only 8% of 
participants across all clinical trials in the 
country in 2020 identified as Black or 
African American, despite this group having 
one of the lowest life expectancies and 
higher mortality from diseases such as CVD.
We include diversity and inclusion princi -
ples in all Phase III studies with US partici -
pation. For example, we consider epidemi -
ology variances for race, ethnicity and 
gender for target disease indications 
during feasibility planning and trial recruit -
ment. We plan to extend this approach to 
all studies worldwide. To increase recruitment of under-represented 
groups in our trials, we are working with 
patient groups and through community 
partnerships – including with churches in 
Atlanta and with our partners in Beacon of 
Hope (see page 58  for details of this program). 
In one example, we leveraged these relation -
ships to help enroll patients in a Phase III trial 
of Entresto  for heart failure in the US. As a 
result, 50% of patients enrolled from these 
sites and 22% of patients overall in the trial 
were from under-represented groups.
T o increase recruitment of under-
represented groups in our trials, 
we are working with patient 
groups and through community 
partnerships 
In 2022, the FDA issued new guidance on 
diversity in clinical trials. In response, we 
are now updating our guidelines to incorpo -
rate the guidance into our priority programs 
from 2023.

APPENDICES37 Novartis in Society Integrated Report |Managed and post-trial access programs
Our managed access programs (MAPs) 
provide eligible patients – those with serious 
or life-threatening illnesses – with access to 
medicines not yet approved or available in 
their home countries. In 2022, we reviewed 
7 730 MAP requests from physicians from 
80 countries and across 55 compounds. We 
approved 94% of these. By the end of 2022, 
more than 9 700 patients were receiving 
treatment under Novartis MAPs.
We are the first pharmaceutical 
company to publish peer-
reviewed research on our MAPs, 
spanning more than 30 000 
patient requests from 110 
countries over three years
We are the first pharmaceutical company 
to publish peer-reviewed research  on our 
MAPs, spanning more than 30 000 patient 
requests from 110 countries over three years. Results showed an average approval 
rate of approximately 95%. Most programs 
(87%) took place in high-income countries, 
those with compassionate use regulations 
made available online (94%) and those with 
a high level of clinical trial activity (96%). 
This research is intended to inform discus -
sions among policymakers, regulators and 
the industry on how to broaden access to 
patients through compassionate use.
Our post-trial access (PTA) policy, which 
applies to all confirmatory clinical trials 
and trials for serious and/or life-threatening 
conditions, ensures patients who have 
derived clinical benefit from an investiga -
tional treatment can continue to receive it, 
free of charge, until it is commercially avail -
able and accessible locally. Our PTA policy 
applies regardless of the severity of the 
disease, the availability of alternative thera -
pies, or the location of the clinical trial. PTA 
plans were incorporated in all in-scope trials 
approved in 2022. See the Novartis Position 
on Post-Trial Access  for more information.

APPENDICES41|our marketing and sales activities and intro -
ducing more efficient end-to-end manage -
ment across our research, development and 
commercial operations.
This new structure became fully opera -
tional in January 2023. We estimate these 
changes will result in cost savings of 
approximately USD 1.5 billion by 2024, 
freeing up resources for investment in 
research and development (R&D) and 
delivering returns to shareholders. In the 
short term, we expect the impact of these 
productivity gains to help offset moderately 
rising energy costs and inflationary pres -
sures in our supply chain. 
Excellence in manufacturing
In 2022, we worked to further increase 
efficiency across our manufacturing sites. 
We introduced new innovative manufactur -
ing techniques, such as continuous manu -facturing, based on an end-to-end, uninter -
rupted production line. We also automated 
more processes, such as packaging lines 
and inspection of prefilled syringes, and 
introduced 3D printing for spare parts. At 
the same time, we switched more of our 
production to cleaner energy and improved 
our environmental performance. 
In recent years, we have been adapting our 
sites, consolidating production where possi -
ble, particularly in small molecules and 
generics where we face most competition. 
Since 2019, we have closed, exited or sold 
17 manufacturing sites and have announced 
the closure, exit or sale of nine additional sites. 
In parallel, we have been expanding capac -
ity in strategic focus areas such as biophar -
maceuticals and advanced technology 
platforms such as radioligand therapy. In 
2022, we were given approval for a new 
16 000m2 facility in Durham, North Carolina, 
to produce Zolgensma , our gene therapy for 
spinal muscular atrophy. We also began 
operations at a new, state-of-the-art bio -
pharmaceuticals plant in Austria that uses 
continuous and automated process technol -
ogies. In addition, we began siRNA drug 
substance production for our cholesterol 
drug Leqvio  in Switzerland, expanded 
radioligand therapy (RLT) production in the 
US and Europe, and continued work on our 
new RLT facility in Indiana, US, which is due 
to come into operation in 2023. 
These changes mirror developments in our 
product mix and help us retain flexibility, so we maintain supplies and react quickly to  
fluctuations in demand. We increased 
production of Cosentyx  and Tafinlar  across 
various sites after the two medicines were 
added to China’s national reimbursement 
list. Overall, we produced approximately 
72.5 billion treatments in 2022, ensuring a 
continuous and reliable supply of our 
medicines to patients worldwide.
During the year, we also stepped up our 
contract manufacturing business, through 
which we leverage our manufacturing facili -
ties and expertise, including in gene and cell 
therapy, to produce medicines for third-party 
customers alongside our own. Our sites in 
Singapore, the US and Europe are producing 
medicines and vaccines for other pharmaceu -
tical companies. Contract manufacturing 
means we can increase capacity utilization at 
our sites while giving customers access to 
high-quality manufacturing expertise. In 2022, we introduced a new 
operating model to make our 
organization more agile and 
efficient in support of our strategy. 
We also took further steps to 
transform our manufacturing 
network, improve supply chain 
management and reduce our 
environmental footprint.
Focusing our organization
In recent years, we have evolved from being 
a diversified healthcare conglomerate to a 
focused, innovative medicines company. 
Announced in April 2022, our new organiza -
tional structure aligns the way we operate 
with this strategy. 
We integrated our former Novartis Pharma -
ceuticals and Oncology units under our 
Innovative Medicines Division with separate 
US and international commercial organiza -
tional units. We also integrated our manu -
facturing and business services teams into 
a single Operations organization and 
integrated our corporate functions.
These changes – part of our Transforming 
for Growth initiative – are designed to power 
our next phase of innovation, growth and 
productivity by sharpening our focus on our 
core business. Creating a simpler, more 
agile organization will enable us to take 
quicker decisions and scale the use of new 
technologies, while reducing duplications in Embed operational excellence

APPENDICES42 Novartis in Society Integrated Report |Progress against ESG targets   Supply chain
T arget Progress
Conduct risk assessments for all new eligible 
suppliers100% (conducted via TPRM process)we carry out regular risk assessments and 
audits in risk areas including health and safety, 
labor rights, information security and anti-  
bribery and corruption. We also work with 
suppliers to reduce their environmental 
impact (see section below). 
In 2022, we extended our third-party risk 
assessments downstream to include whole -
salers and distributors of our medicines, and 
updated our expectations for suppliers to 
carry out due diligence on human rights. 
Over the past three years, we have assessed 
nearly 97% of our tier one suppliers in 
Operations that play a critical role in our 
supply chain. Of these, only around 1% were 
considered high-risk. 
Sustainability in our supply chain
Environmental sustainability criteria  have 
been integrated in supply contracts covering 
more than a third of our Scope 3 supplier 
emissions. Our plan is to increase this to all 
suppliers by 2025. To support our approach, 
we are engaging with suppliers to develop 
sustainability roadmaps – part of our goal to 
achieve carbon neutrality across our value 
chain by 2030 and to be net zero by 2040. More than 90% of carbon emissions associ -
ated with our business are generated outside 
our own operations.
Protecting patient health and safety
Patient health and safety is fundamental to our 
business. We cannot deliver on our purpose if 
we do not provide safe, high-quality medicines. 
Our activities are focused on three areas: 
manu facturing safe medicines (product 
quality); ensuring these medicines remain safe 
and that we identify possible adverse events to 
minimize risks to patients (pharmacovigilance); 
and combating falsified medicines, which can 
pose a serious threat to human health.
Product quality 
All our facilities operate under strict regula -
tions from regulatory health authorities. 
Health authorities regularly inspect our 
facilities to ensure we are complying with all 
relevant laws and standards. In 2022, health 
authorities, including the European Medi -
cines Agency (EMA), Swissmedic and the 
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), carried out a total of 139 inspections. Of 
these, 100% were found to be acceptable, 
up from 99.2% in 2021. Novartis also 
routinely audits suppliers and other partners 
to ensure quality standards are maintained. 
We carry out thorough investigations into 
safety issues with our products, and act 
quickly to address any concerns. For exam -
ple, in May we suspended production of our 
Pluvicto  radioligand therapy for prostate 
cancer at two sites in Italy and the US to 
address quality concerns in their manufac -
ture. After remediating the issues, we 
restarted production in June and resumed 
delivery of doses to patients. These issues 
did not affect patient safety, and no risk to 
patients from the doses previously pro -
duced at these sites was identified. 
During the year, we had 19 recalls – 7 for IM 
and 12 for Sandoz. None were related to 
Class I, where medicines in question could 
result in serious health problems. Recalls 
are carried out in agreement with the 
relevant health authorities. Investing in early-stage technical  
development
In September, we announced a USD 300 
million investment in early technical devel -
opment capabilities for next-generation 
biotherapeutics at facilities in Switzerland, 
Slovenia and Austria. Biotherapeutics 
currently account for around half of all new 
drug approvals and have enormous potential 
to treat unmet patient needs across a range 
of diseases. Spanning both drug substance 
and drug product development, this invest -
ment is expected to lead to faster transition 
times from pre-clinical to first-in-human 
studies, helping to put Novartis at the 
forefront of biotherapeutic development.
Supply chain management 
We work with thousands of external part -
ners worldwide, from suppliers in our R&D 
organization to wholesalers and distributors, 
who ensure our medicines reach patients. 
The diversity and geographic spread of our 
supply chain makes it highly resilient, even in 
times of pandemic or other economic shocks. 
We contractually oblige third-party suppliers 
to abide by our standards on quality, ethics, 
and human rights. To support this approach,

maintain a high level of compliance to 
regulatory requirements for both individual 
case safety reports and periodic benefit-risk 
assessments.  
Reports of adverse events from various 
sources, including clinical studies and 
spontaneous reports, are used to evaluate 
and optimize risk management actions for 
the proper use of our medicines. As an 
example, following two patient fatalities we 
updated the label for Zolgensma , in align -
ment with health authorities, to specify that 
fatal acute liver failure had been reported. 
While this is clinically important safety information, it is not a new safety signal, and 
we firmly believe in the overall favorable 
risk-benefit profile of Zolgensma , which has 
been used to treat more than 2 500 patients 
worldwide. We notified health authorities in 
all markets where Zolgensma  is used, and 
communicated to healthcare professionals 
as an additional step in markets where this 
action is supported by health authorities.
In 2022, we continued to support education 
programs for patients, providers and 
pharmacists. Our pharmacovigilance team 
also supported a program with the UK 
regulatory authority to provide early access 
to two cancer medicines – Scemblix  and 
Pluvicto  – for patients with clear unmet 
medical need before marketing approval 
was received later in the year.Combating falsified medicines
The illicit trade in falsified medicines is a 
threat to patient safety and an increasingly 
significant issue for health systems around 
the world. The Pharmaceutical Security 
Institute reported a 38% increase in phar -
maceutical crime incidents between 2016 
and 2021, leading to an all-time high in 2021. 
Our strategy is focused on two areas: the 
quick authentication and reporting of 
falsified medicines, as well as collective 
action to address the issue. In 2022, we 
investigated 213 incidents in 48 countries 
and worked closely with law enforcement on 
74 enforcement actions which led to the 
seizure of approximately 1.2 million units of 
falsified medicines. Since 2017, our efforts 
have prevented serious safety risks for an 
estimated 1.8 million patients.
We plan to roll out 250 Authentifield  sensors 
in 75 countries in May 2023. These sensors 
enable our Innovative Medicines employees 
to rapidly authenticate (solid) drug products, 
which is vital in preventing falsified medicines 
reaching patients. Meanwhile, our MoVe 
internal mobile application, which enables 
employees to quickly verify the authenticity 
of secondary packaging of any Novartis 
product, is now active in 49 countries. 
In 2022, Novartis also engaged over 8 100 key 
stakeholders across 27 countries on topics 
including public awareness, policy, and 
capacity-building. We voluntarily reported 
100% of confirmed incidents to the WHO, 95% 
within the recommended 10-day timeframe.Environmental sustainability 
We continue to reduce emissions, water 
consumption and waste sent for disposal in 
our own operations, in line with our 2025 
targets. In 2022, we also introduced envi -
ronmental sustainability criteria into suppli -
ers’ contracts and started engaging with 
them to define actions to reduce emissions 
in our supply chain.
Our environmental sustainability strategy  
and engagement activities are consistent 
with limiting global warming to below 1.5°C 
compared to pre-industrial levels in line with 
the goals of the Paris Agreement. We 
committed to the Science Based Targets 
Initiative (SBTi) to develop science-based 
targets in accordance with the SBTi Net 
Zero standard. We also joined The Climate 
Pledge which is working toward net-zero by 
2040, in line with our own target.
To accelerate progress across the pharma -
ceutical sector and other industries, we 
work closely with organizations such as the 
AMR (antimicrobial resistance) Industry 
Alliance, Pharmaceutical Environmental 
Group, World Business Council for Sustain -
able Development and the Pharmaceutical 
Supply Chain Initiative.

In 2022, we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 
emissions by 23% from the prior year, 
representing a reduction of 49% compared 
with our 2016 baseline. We have been steadily 
reducing our emissions for several years, 
mainly through energy efficiency, increased 
use of renewables and new manufacturing 
technologies. 
We are committed to using 100% renewable 
electricity across our operations by 2025. 
In 2022, we had renewable power purchase 
agreements in place to cover electricity 
consumption across our operations in Europe 
and North America. 
Currently, 20 of our manufacturing sites are 
certified under ISO 14001 (Environmental 
Management) or the EU’s Eco-Management 
and Audit Scheme – equivalent to about half 
of our total production by volume. 
Our Scope 3 emissions increased by 20% 
from the prior year, driven primarily by 
purchased goods and services and, to a 
lesser extent, by increased business travel 
following the pandemic. The calculation of 
emissions from purchased goods and 
services is based on proxy (spending) data 
and statistical modelling. The resulting 
figure provides an approximate reflection of 
emissions based on industry averages. Over 
time, we plan to move to a calculation based 
on primary activity data, which we expect 
will give a more accurate representation of our Scope 3 emissions and better highlight 
our efforts to engage with our suppliers on 
environmental sustainability.
Waste
In 2022, we continued efforts to reduce 
waste sent for disposal. We have introduced 
sustainable design guidelines for our prod -
ucts, devices and packaging. Where feasible, 
we are switching to recycled plastics, cutting 
back on the use of blister packs and increas -
ing the use of reusable shipping boxes. Since 
2016, we have reduced the amount of waste 
sent for disposal by 59%. 
Water
We have continued to reduce our water 
consumption by using more recycled water 
(where local regulations allow) and adopting 
less water-intensive production techniques. 
Since 2016, our water use has reduced 
by 42%.
In 2022, we began to classify our facilities 
based on whether they are in areas affected 
by water scarcity. The initial results showed 
that 36 locations contributing approximately 
11% of our water consumption are in areas of 
high risk or very high risk as defined by the 
WWF Water Risk Filter. During 2023 we plan 
to conduct operational water risk assess -
ments at 15 priority locations with the highest 
water consumption to determine actions 
needed to ensure we become water neutral 
at these locations. We aim to be water 
neutral at all our locations by 2030.

APPENDICES45 Novartis in Society Integrated Report |Supporting global efforts to combat climate change
UN SDG target 13.2 reads: 
Integrate climate change 
measures into national 
policies, strategies and 
planning.
Please see page 23 for 
more information on our 
impact on the SDGsHealthcare contributes almost 5% to global greenhouse gas 
emissions1. But the effects of climate change cut both ways: 
rising temperatures and air pollution are also harming human 
health and, in some cases, changing disease patterns. Reducing 
greenhouse gases lies at the heart of the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals and the Paris Climate Agreement, which 
aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. 
Many countries around the world are decarbonizing their 
healthcare systems. So far, 50 have made the pledge, including 
Germany, the US, the UK and emerging markets such as Indone-
sia and Egypt. If we want retain our position in these markets, we 
must show progress with our own decarbonization program. 
At Novartis, we aim to be net zero by 2040. Over the past two 
years, we have also started introducing environmental sustain-
ability criteria into our supplier contracts, extending this to whole-
salers and distributors in 2022.

We seek to minimize discharge of active 
pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) into water 
systems and do not dispose of waste 
containing APIs in landfill. We regularly 
measure air and water quality to make sure 
we remain within safe limits. We also evalu -
ate the potential impact of new medicines 
on human and environmental health during the R&D process. See our position state -
ment on pharmaceuticals in the environment 
for more information.  In 2022, we engaged 
with more than 100 priority suppliers to 
assess their effluent load of active pharma -
ceutical ingredients in water streams 
against standards from the AMR Industry 
Alliance framework.

for research into new 
medicines for malaria and 
neglected tropical diseasesWith the new organization, we will see a 
reduction in our workforce over the next two 
years. In total, through Transforming for 
Growth we expect to reduce our workforce 
by up to 8 000 positions by the end of 2024. 
In 2022, employee turnover stood at 15%. 
Voluntary turnover was 9%, up from 8% in the 
previous year.
Investing in our culture
We are investing in our culture to help drive 
our long-term performance as a focused 
medicines company. We encourage all 
Novartis employees to be inspired, curious 
and unbossed to unlock innovation and drive 
performance. For us, this is about building 
an agile, diverse workforce and making sure 
we attract and retain talent for the future. Changes to our  
organizational model
Executing on our strategy as a focused 
medicines company requires us to work 
differently. We reorganized our company to 
create a more agile and simpler organization 
that is aligned with our focused strategy and 
will support innovation, growth and produc -
tivity. Regrettably, our Transforming for 
Growth initiative also entails job losses as 
we reshape our company to focus on our 
core Innovative Medicines business. We recognize that these changes cause 
considerable uncertainty for many of our 
employees. To manage the process, we put 
in place six basic principles: 
• Fairness in decision-making:  all  decisions 
were taken in line with our Code of Ethics 
and Values and Behaviors.
• Balanced representation:  where units 
were merged, we ensured proper balance 
in terms of both organizational structure 
and opportunities for leadership positions.
• Equal opportunities : throughout the 
process, we worked to ensure equal oppor -
tunities for all employees to maintain our 
commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion.
• Support and care:  those affected by the 
changes had access to various support 
programs to help them transition to new 
roles, either within or outside Novartis. 
• Social dialogue:  during the process, we 
consulted with Works Councils and other 
employee representative bodies in accor -
dance with local law and regulations.
• Simple approvals:  we simplified approval 
processes so that key decisions could be 
taken as quickly as possible. 
We appointed a dedicated transformation 
team, led by our Executive Committee, issued 
clear guidance to management, and set up 
targeted engagement plans for employees in 
critical roles or identified as top talent. Unleash the power of our people 
Culture helps to drive innovation 
and long-term performance. In 
2022, we moved to an integrated 
company structure to align with  
our focused strategy, while also 
putting in place measures to help 
employees manage through this 
significant change. We also 
continued to phase in new ways of 
working and advanced our efforts 
to increase workforce diversity.

historical salary data
Create pay transparency for employees 
by 2023On track: 47% of employees with pay 
transparency to external benchmarksequity and transparency. Based on the 
latest data available as of December 31, 
2021, Novartis has a global mean pay gap of 
+3.1% and a global median pay gap of 
-3.0%, compared with +3.3% and -2.3%, 
respectively, in the prior year. While we 
acknowledge this percentage is influenced 
by worldwide workforce demographics, our 
global mean pay gap is significantly ahead 
of the Bloomberg benchmark of +19% mean 
for the same period.
Across the organization, we are also 
increasing pay transparency and systemati -
cally removing historical salary data when 
hiring to reduce the likelihood of perpetuat -
ing possible discrimination. At the end of 
2022, 84% of our global hiring was taking 
place on this basis. Our aim is to complete 
preparations for full pay transparency for all 
employees by the end of 2023, in time for 
annual pay discussions in February 2024. We have more than 80 dedicated employee 
resource groups that connect employees 
with shared experiences or backgrounds. We 
also support the UN Standards of Conduct 
for Business to tackle discrimination against 
LGBTQI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, 
queer and intersex) employees and are mem -
bers of the International Labor Organization’s 
(ILO) Global Business and Disability Network. 
In 2022, we received the Stonewall Top 
Global Employer Silver Award and were 
included in the Bloomberg Gender Equality 
Index , a recognition of the progress we 
continue to make in providing a positive and 
inclusive work environment for all employees. 
Through our parental leave program, intro -
duced in 2019, all Novartis employees 
regardless of gender or sexual orientation can benefit from a minimum period of 
14 weeks paid parental leave following the 
birth or adoption of a child, ensuring equity 
and greater flexibility for birthing and 
non-birthing parents.
New ways of working
In recent years, working models have 
become more flexible – a logical step during 
the upheavals of the pandemic. In 2020, we 
took an experimental approach and 
launched a program called Choice with 
Responsibility to give employees more 
flexibility and maintain business continuity, 
while also emphasizing the importance of 
working together onsite on occasions to 
support innovation and strengthen team -
work and collective responsibility. Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI)
We are focused on creating a work environ -
ment in which all employees feel they 
belong and can do their best work. We do 
this not only because it is right, but also 
because it helps generate new ideas, gives 
us access to a wider pool of talent and 
brings us closer to the diverse perspectives 
of customers, patients and other stakehold -
ers. To support this approach, we embed 
DEI into objectives for managers and in 
internal policies and controls, including our 
Code of Ethics . 
Gender equity is an important part of our 
DEI strategy. Women now make up 47% of 
our overall management, compared with 
46% in 2021 and 42% five years ago. 
As part of our public pledge to the UN’s 
Equal Pay International Coalition (EPIC) , we 
are also committed to further improving pay

out by an external consultant to ensure 
independence. In Q4 2022, 69% of Novartis 
employees took part in the survey. Results 
are used on an aggregated basis to identify 
potential risks and make improvements to 
working conditions, training and develop -
ment, access to support programs and other 
areas where necessary.
Learning, growth and  
leadership development
We want a future-ready workforce that can 
achieve our strategic objectives. To do this, 
we continue to promote curiosity, learning 
and growth, which helps us to adapt to our 
changing business environment and ensures 
we build strategic skills, particularly in areas 
such as R&D, data science, and launch 
excellence to drive performance.
Since 2019, we have made significant 
investments in learning and development 
through our ‘Going Big on Learning’ initiative, 
which has led to an approximately 50% 
increase in average employee learning hours 
since 2018. In 2022, employees dedicated 
an average of 42.4 hours to learning. While 
this was down from 52.1 hours in the previ -
ous year, largely due to the impact of organi -
zational changes in our business, it was still 
ahead of pre-pandemic levels.   
Although overall learning objectives and 
investments are being recalibrated in line 
with the broader organizational transforma -
tion at Novartis, we continue to prioritize As the pandemic has subsided in many 
countries, we have made the decision to 
further evolve our approach to hybrid work -
ing to increase our focus on collaboration 
and innovation. Our updated guidance was 
announced in 2022 and will be implemented 
in 2023 pending local consultations and 
country-specific requirements, including 
local health and safety regulations. We aim to 
provide flexibility where it makes sense, while 
also prioritizing time spent together, encour -
aging a team-first mindset, and giving greater 
clarity and accountability to our teams. 
The diversity of roles across our organiza -
tion allows for different levels of flexibility. 
As a result, we have provided specific 
guidance for our field force, office workers, 
lab workers and manufacturing workers.
Employee engagement
We measure employee engagement every 
quarter. The engagement score decreased 
in the second half of 2022 to 73, two points 
below the global benchmark. Engagement 
favorability, which measures the percentage of 
“agree” or “strongly agree” survey responses, 
was 76% in the fourth quarter, compared 
with 85% a year earlier. This outcome was 
anticipated following the announcement of 
our Transforming for Growth initiative. 
The engagement score is based on 
responses to two questions: “How happy are 
you at Novartis?” and “Would you recom -
mend Novartis as a great place to work?”. 
The voluntary and anonymous survey, which learning as a key part of our culture to drive 
innovation and performance. Alongside 
mandatory training in areas like ethics and 
health and safety, approximately 36 000 
employees took courses through LinkedIn 
and Coursera on a range of topics including 
data science, digital skills and marketing. 
In addition, more than 11 000 managers 
have taken part in our Unbossed Leadership 
Experience pro   gram since 2020, which gives 
them the skills to lead cultural change within 
the organization. We also provide dedicated 
training to first-time managers.
Match is our cross-company online platform 
that allows employees to take charge of 
their own learning and career development 
through a range of offerings, from jobs and 
mentoring opportunities to short-term 
project assignments and ‘bite-sized’ training 
modules. In 2022, we rolled out Match 
across the company. The number of users 
increased to over 33 000 – with more than 
900 mentorships, over 350 project assign -
ments and about 250 000 learning units on 
the platform completed. 
Performance management  
and career development
All Novartis employees receive support for 
performance management and career 
development through a flexible, continuous 
system of coaching, feedback and recogni -
tion by managers and colleagues. Teams 
and individuals create objectives that focus 
on both short- and longer-term impact. In addition, managers and employees have 
regular discussions on topics including 
progress toward goals, development, 
feedback and well-being.
Supporting mental health and well-being
Mental health is increasingly in the spotlight 
as the COVID-19 pandemic and other 
factors have taken a toll on people’s mental, 
social and physical well-being. The effects 
of stress on daily life is the most frequently 
reported mental health issue globally, 
according to the Ipsos World Mental Health 
Day 2022 survey. 
At Novartis, we have a dedicated well-being 
program for employees, known as Ener -
gized for Life. In 2022, we stepped up our 
employee assistance programs and e-train -
ing, as we recognized that Transforming for 
Growth would inevitably add to pressures 
for many employees. 
In February, we launched a new version of 
“How are you feeling?”, an online library of 
tools and resources, accessed by over 10 
500 employees during the year. We also 
added a question on well-being to our 
regular employee engagement survey.
We measure employee attitudes before and 
after our well-being programs to ensure we 
are on the right track. Figures for 2022 
show those participating in our programs 
had better work-life balance, communicated 
more with colleagues and were able to 
manage their time more effectively.

APPENDICES50 Novartis in Society Integrated Report |Providing a safe and secure working environment
Our commitment to occupational health and safety is built into  
our Code of Ethics. In addition, we have strict health and safety 
controls across our sites that go beyond legal requirements: 
• At all our sites, we conduct regular audits to assess compliance 
 with regulations and internal controls.
• We also carry out risk assessments to determine the necessary 
frequency of these audits, and have crisis management plans in 
place to deal with emergency situations. 
• Both our own employees and outside contractors receive regular 
health and safety training 
Health and safety standards are also incorporated into our supplier 
contracts and risk assessments. In addition, 18 of our sites have 
ISO 45001 certification, covering 35% of employees and third-party 
personnel working in manufacturing and supply.
Safety incident rates returned to pre-pandemic levels in 2022, 
consistent with industry benchmarks. However, over the longer term 
we continue to see improvement with the total recordable incident 
rate for employees and third-party personnel trending downwards, 
due in part to the implementation of new management systems.UN SDG target 8.8 reads: 
Protect labor rights and 
promote safe and secure 
working environments for all 
workers, including migrant 
workers, in particular women 
migrants, and those in 
precarious employment. 
Please see page 23 for 
more information on our 
impact on the SDGsEngaging employees through  
volunteering
Our Novartis Engagement & Volunteering 
Program empowers employees to make a 
difference through giving, community 
initiatives and skills-based volunteering with 
civil society partners in a chosen commu -
nity. Over time, the program has evolved into 
a sustainable, skills-based model that 
generates impact for employees, Novartis, 
partners and society in areas that are 
aligned with our strategy and purpose.
We signed a new partnership 
with the UN High Commissioner 
for Refugees, while also 
providing support for those 
affected by the war in Ukraine
In 2022 we signed new partnerships with 
organizations such as the UN High Commis -
sioner for Refugees, while also providing 
support for those affected by the war in 
Ukraine (see page 61 ). Our projects over the 
past year included mentoring health-tech 
entrepreneurs, supporting environmental 
sustainability in the supply chain, and working 
with the UN on projects for innovation.
 Wages and cost of living 
Novartis is committed to paying employees 
a living wage that meets or exceeds the 
amount for basic living needs, in line with 
our UN Global Compact commitment.
The cost of living is understandably a con -
cern for many of our employees as inflation 
remains high in many countries. While we 
continue to monitor macroeconomic condi -
tions, we do not make changes to pay based 
solely on inflation – we also consider factors 
such as our competitive position, business 
needs and our EPIC and Living Wage com -
mitments. Historically, our approach has led 
to salary increases in many countries above 
the local rate of inflation. 
Our Employee Share Purchase Plan enables 
employees to voluntarily purchase Novartis 
shares at a discounted price. The plan 
currently covers employees in North  America 
(the US, Puerto Rico and Canada), with 
rollout to employees in other countries and 
regions scheduled over the next several 
years. All permanent employees are eligible 
for the plan (with certain exceptions).

Nerve Live program collects data from 
dozens of domains to generate insights, 
drive efficiency and reduce risk – for exam -
ple to keep clinical trials running smoothly or 
helping with oversight of drug safety opera -
tions for our portfolio. The program has 
been successfully scaled after launching 
five years ago, with thousands of employees 
now using Nerve Live’s decision-support 
tools to help them in their daily work.
Andromeda, which was launched in 2020 
and is now used by more than 10 000 
employees, is a solution that covers the 
entire portfolio of Novartis, spanning 
research, development and our commercial 
operations. It uses advanced analytics and 
simulations to accelerate portfolio deci -
sion-making, helping to drive efficiency and 
contributing to the value of our pipeline.
Our data42 platform gives our data scientists 
and researchers access to 2 million patient 
years of data from thousands of clinical trials 
over more than two decades. Backed by 
robust privacy controls for patient data, it 
enables researchers to analyze millions of 
health records, genomic data, adverse events 
and other information to generate hypotheses 
and test them through statistical modeling. 
Today, this data analytics platform is being 
used by over 1 100 Novartis data scientists 
and researchers.Our Generative Chemistry project, for 
example, helps scientists at the Novartis 
Institutes for Biomedical Research (NIBR) 
speed up the discovery of new high-value 
medicines. The process for researching and 
developing new medicines is complex, 
requiring the evaluation of hundreds of 
thousands of candidate compounds before 
a project reaches the clinical trial stage. We 
use machine learning algorithms to identify 
new patterns and suggest molecules to 
synthesize in the lab. 
More than 250 specialist data 
scientists are embedded within 
NIBR project teams to help 
optimize and accelerate key 
aspects of our research
This is just one example of how data science 
has become a pillar of our drug discovery 
efforts. More than 250 specialist data 
scientists are embedded within NIBR project 
teams to help optimize and accelerate key 
aspects of our research – from target 
identification and dose modeling to refining 
predictive biomarkers. In pre-clinical and 
early clinical work, for instance, NIBR data 
scientists created a neural network model 
to assess brain penetration potential for 
several neurological drug candidates. Using 
biodistribution data, they also developed a 
method to accurately predict how doses of 
an investigational radioligand therapy would 
be absorbed by key radiosensitive organs. Scale data science and technology
We are investing in data science 
and technology to support 
innovation, increase efficiency, 
better respond to the needs of 
patients and healthcare pro -
fessionals, and ultimately improve 
the way we develop and deliver 
our medicines. 
To support our strategy, we use data 
science and technologies such as artificial 
intelligence (AI) across our company. 
Internally, we are investing to build a 
strong data, digital and IT foundation for 
our own systems and processes – span -
ning everything from R&D and operations 
to product management and commercial 
activities. We are also using data science 
and technology to better meet the needs 
of customers and patients. As part of our 
overall strategy, we focus on priority 
projects that can be scaled globally and 
have the highest impact.
Supporting innovation
Our business produces enormous amounts 
of data, not only from research and devel -
opment but also from production, distribu -
tion and marketing. We are taking advan -
tage of this resource to improve 
productivity and spur innovation. Related links and disclosures:

Building a data and digital backbone
We are making progress in modernizing our 
IT systems and connecting the large volumes 
of data created throughout our business. 
In 2020, we launched a common platform 
for data and analytics aimed at maximizing 
the value of our data. Today, this platform 
is used at scale across the company to 
generate reliable data in a standard format 
and enable insights using AI and machine 
learning. Ultimately, this will speed up 
decision-making, increase efficiency and 
provide new insights.
Through our Lean Digital Core (LDC) 
program, we are replacing our legacy 
enterprise resource planning systems with 
a single system across our organization. 
This will simplify how we work and allow for 
easier and more cost-effective upgrades. 
We anticipate cost savings of approximately 
USD 500 million as a result.

the Novartis Foundation’s 
AI4HealthyCities program, 
with more planned for 2023.In 2022, the Novartis Foundation launched the AI4HealthyCities 
Health Equity Network alongside Microsoft AI for Health and 
other partners. The aim is to use artificial intelligence to analyze 
health data and provide city authorities with insights into the 
main social determinants of heart disease so they can direct 
more resources to high-impact interventions. New York, US, and 
Lisbon, Portugal, are the first cities to take part in the program, 
with further major cities planned for 2023. 
Insights from the program could increase understanding about 
heart disease and how heart health could be improved by 
tackling the underlying social, economic or environmental 
causes. These include everything from healthy diet and physical 
exercise to education, exposure to pollution and access to 
decent housing.   
The Novartis Foundation seeks to improve the health of low-in-
come populations around the world and reduce health inequity 
by using data and population health management.

Patient Support Center (PSC) to help patients 
more easily access our medicines through 
financial and adherence support. In 2022, 
Leap was fully integrated into our US patient 
support activities for Entresto . We also 
began a scaled rollout to Cosentyx  patients. 
We plan to cover the full Novartis product 
portfolio in the US by the end of 2024.
Leap uses technology and real-

At the same time, our Next Generation 
Engagement program uses a mix of data 
analysis, behavioral insights and communica -
tions technology to achieve the most effec -
tive mix of face-to-face and digital communi -
cations for healthcare professionals in key 
markets. For example, we personalized 36% 
of touchpoints with healthcare professionals 
for Cosentyx  in the US. This personalized 
approach has led to increased customer 
engagement and supported sales growth.
 To support these changes, we are standard -
izing around 700 internal end-to-end 
processes used by our finance, procure -
ment, manufacturing and commercial teams. 
We aim for initial deployment of LDC in two 
countries by the end of 2023 and expect the 
overall program to be completed by 2028. 
Alongside LDC, we are investing in new 
technology for human capital management 
(HCM), built around Workday, a third-party 
software platform. This new approach will 
replace more than 15 global and local 
systems currently in use with just four 
global systems. With this change, we will be 
able to improve how we recruit, manage 
and develop our employees, as well as simp   lify 
and speed up our HR processes. In addi -
tion, both employees and managers will 
have access to new tools for training and 
career development. The project will be 
implemented in waves over the next two 
years, with the first wave scheduled for the 
second half of 2023.

our medicines based on the value they deliver to patients, healthcare systems and society. We also use innovative access and pricing models, taking into account local income levels, affordability barriers and economic realities. R&D:  We systematically 
assess our product portfolio against the unmet needs of underserved populations. We aim to make our products available in countries with the highest burden of the disease to be treated.

systemsNovartis Access Principles
We systematically integrate access strategies into how we research, 
develop and deliver our new medicines globally.These strategies include innovative 
approaches to affordability, such as sustain -
able business models and value-based pricing, as well as efforts to adapt medicines for different patient groups or for diverse environments. While affordability and 
 a
vailability remain key issues, the ability of 
health systems to effectively use innovative medicines is another critical barrier to access.  
In 2022, we pledged additional funding 
for research into new medicines for neglected tropical diseases. We became the first pharmaceutical company to contribute an innovative medicine to the a
s possible. We have been committed to 
increasing access to medicines for decades. Over the years, we have moved from a donations-based approach to one that employs a combination of access models for more sustainable social impact. In 2022, our access programs and initiatives reached 54.6 million patients worldwide. 
Our targets
To reinforce our commitment to access, we have set key targets covering both our strategic innovative therapies and our global health priorities ( see page 55 ). 
In 2022, we achieved a 26% increase in patients reached with our strategic innova-tive therapies in LMICs compared with the previous year, representing an increase of 119% since 2019. Patients reached through our global health programs declined by 5% from the prior year, driven by increased availability of generic alternatives due to the easing of COVID-19-related supply disrup -
tions in the wider industry. However, we remain on track to meet our target as the latest figure represents an increase of 107% from 2019.
Our approach
To achieve our targets, we work to improve access for patients across the lifecycle of our medicines. We are guided by the 
 N
ovartis Access Principles , which commit 
us to systematically integrate access strategies in how we research, develop and deliver our new medicines. Build trust with society
We aim to increase access to our 
medicines for  underserved 
populations around the world, and 
follow high standards of ethical 
behavior wherever we operate. In 
2022, we pledged investment for 
research into new medicines for 
neglected tropical diseases while 
advancing partnerships to enhance 
cardio vas cular and cancer care for 
patients across the world. 
Access to medicines
Despite r ecent med ical a dvances, bi llions   
of people around the world still lack access 
to the medicines an d healthcare s ervices 
they need. 
Many of the most acute issues are in 
low- and middle-incom e countries (L MICs), 
which face the dual burden of infectious 
and no n-communicable d iseases ( NCDs), 
as well as fragile  and under-resourced health 
systems. But the COVID-19 pandemic also 
exposed d eep h ealth in equities in h igher-in -
come countries, where barriers to access 
are often linked to structural health system 
issues as well as demographic, social and 
econ omic  challenges.

several years. See page 59  for details of our 
integrated approach to tackling SCD. 
Malaria
According to the WHO, there were an 
esti mated 619 000 malaria deaths globally 
in 2021, despite it being a preventable and 
treatable disease. Novartis has been involved 
in the fight against malaria for decades. 
Since 1999, we have delivered more than one 
billion treatments of artemisinin-  based 
combination therapy (ACT) to endemic 
countries, of which over 90% were supplied 
on a zero-profit basis. We are developing a 
new optimized dose of ACT for use in infants ATOM   Coalition to treat chronic myeloid 
 leukemia ( see page 56 ). We also expanded 
our 20-year collaboration with the Max 
Foundation to drive access to our innovative 
breast cancer treatment, in addition to 
chronic myeloid leukemia, and we launched 
key partnerships with health systems in both 
high-income countries and LMICs.  
Novartis global health priorities
Our work on global health is aligned with our 
overall efforts to expand access to our 
medicines. We follow an integrated approach 
for the elimination or control of four diseases 
where there has been market failure and little 
investment in research and development:
Sickle cell disease (SCD)
Every day, an estimated 1 000 children are 
born in Africa with SCD. Of those, more than 
half die before their fifth birthday due to 
preventable complications from the illness.

announced our decision to proceed to Phase 
III clinical trials in 2023 for our lead malaria 
pipeline program (see page 37 ).
Chagas disease 
Chagas disease causes around 12 000 deaths 
a year. The disease is endemic in 21 countries, 
mostly in Latin America. Fewer than 1% of 
the six million people infected receive 
proper antiparasitic treatment. Starting as a 
parasitic disease, Chagas disease can lead 
to chronic heart disorders in up to 30% of 
patients. We are conducting a Phase IV study 
in patients with the cardiac form of Chagas 
disease in collaboration with the Brazilian 
Clinical Research Institute, and working to 
strengthen health care systems in Brazil, 
Mexico, and Bolivia. Novartis is also a member 
of the Global Chagas Disease Coalition.
Leprosy 
Currently, an estimated 2-3 million people 
live with leprosy. Over the past 30 years, 
great strides have been made in treating the 
disease through multidrug therapy (MDT). Since 2000, Novartis donations of MDT 
packs have treated over 7.5 million people. In 
2020, we renewed our pledge to continue 
donations for another five years. We are also 
working with the WHO on a process to 
reliably replenish the stocks of medicines 
used to treat leprosy. 
Research and development 
We assess our R&D work against the needs 
of underserved populations and integrate 
access considerations and evidence needs 
for LMICs early into the development process. 
We begin anticipating potential access 
barriers and enablers for our investigational 
medicines at the end of Phase II development. 
To further improve access, we do not file or 
enforce patents in low-income countries. 
In 2022, we pledged to invest USD 250 
million for research into new medicines for 
malaria and neglected tropical diseases 
such as Chagas disease and leishmaniasis 
(see page 34 ).

cancer medicines 
Novartis is a founding member of the Access to Oncology 
Medicines (ATOM) Coalition, a public-private partnership that 
aims to build a new sustainable access model for cancer medi-
cines. Novartis is the first pharmaceutical company to contribute 
an innovative medicine to ATOM. We granted a “freedom to

nilotinib1, which was developed to treat chronic myeloid leukemia.
The agreement allows the Medicines Patent Pool, a United 
Nations-backed public health organization, to sub-license nilotnib 
to generic manufacturers who will be able to manu facture and 
commercialize the medicine in those markets. The approach has 
been tested successfully with communicable diseases like HIV 
and COVID-19, but never in cancer. We hope this will provide a 
new model for the sector to increase access to life-changing 
medicines for non-communicable diseases. 
We know that making medicines available is only one part of the 
journey to improve access. Collaboration with our ATOM Coalition 
partners in diagnostics, training and delivery will also be critical to 
help meet our collective goal of bringing the most appropriate 
medical interventions to everyone who needs them.1st

pharmaceutical company to 
contribute an innovative 
medicine to the A TOM 
coalition, a public-private 
partnership aimed at building 
a new sustainable model for 
access to cancer medicines.

and adherence to medication. These 
include Novartis Patient Assistance in the 
US and Novartis Oncology Access for 
patients across Asia and the Middle East. 
Overall, we have around 800 active patient 
support programs in 80 countries.
To drive access in SSA, we launched a 
dedicated unit in 2019 to focus on reaching 
more patients in the region across several 
therapeutic areas through sustainable 
business models. We deliver our portfolio of 
medicines across the income pyramid in 
SSA and have established an ecosystem of 
local partners to drive impact and reach 
more patients across income levels. 
Our Novartis Access program, an innovative 
business model to increase access to 
on- and off-patent medicines for noncom -
municable diseases (NCDs) in countries 
across Africa, Latin America and Asia, 
evolved in 2022. The aim of this was to 
address the complexity of health system 
barriers that, along with a lack of access to 
high-quality and affordable medicines, 
contribute to poor health outcomes. To 
further drive impact and integrate the 
approach into our core business, we 
increased the flexibility of the product 
offering, broadened distribution to additional 
channels, and took steps to address health 
system needs that may inhibit access to 
these medicines. Beyond our investigational therapies, we 
also adapt existing medicines for different 
patient groups or for diverse environments. 
In 2022, we launched a pediatric friendly 
formulation of hydroxyurea, a treatment for 
sickle cell disease, in Ghana, with plans to 
expand to Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.
Affordability and availability
We use a combination of approaches to 
make our medicines affordable for patients 
across the income pyramid. 
In high-income and upper-middle income 
countries, we seek to price our medicines 
based on the value they deliver to patients, 
health systems and society. We believe this 
approach incentivizes health systems to 
focus on interventions that deliver the most 
effective, efficient and sustainable outcomes. 
For more information on our position 
on  value-based pricing, please see our 
 corporate website.
In LMICs, we implement tiered pricing for 
launches of our strategic innovative thera -
pies, taking income levels, local affordability 
barriers and economic realities into consider -
ation. This approach supports governments 
in responding to unmet medical needs in a 
way that is sustainable for our business. All 
our medicine launches in 2022 included a 
tiered pricing strategy for LMICs. 
Additionally, we have support programs to 
help patients facing financial hardship or 
other barriers to access, as well as to

APPENDICES56|For over 30 years, Novartis has been working 
with partners around the world to eliminate 
leprosy. Since 2000, through the WHO, 
Novartis has donated more than 70 million 
blister packs of multidrug therapy (MDT) 
 valued at approximately USD 124 million, 
helping to treat more than 7.5 million leprosy 
patients worldwide. Our agreement with the 
WHO also covers donations of triclabenda -
zole for the treatment of fascioliasis, a 
disease caused by parasites known as liver 
fluke. Novartis has been donating the medi -
cine to the WHO since 2005. 
Health system strengthening
Barriers to access are complex: while afford -
ability and availability remain key issues, the 
ability of health systems to effectively use 
innovative medicines is another barrier. We 
work closely with governments and civil 
society to strengthen health systems and 
lower barriers to healthcare delivery. 
We follow a systematic, enterprise-wide 
approach. Health system strengthening 
(HSS) is being integrated throughout our 
core business planning processes, and all 
Novartis launches have a global HSS 
strategy for local adaptation. 
Current projects include reducing delays in 
breast cancer diagnosis due to COVID-19 
backlogs through clinic optimization in Portugal and helping to establish heart 
failure clinics in 14 LMICs to reduce the high 
re-admission rates many patients face 
following heart failure. Our Avoidable 
Blindness program executed partnerships 
across four countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, 
focusing on strengthening policy, primary 
care integration and referral networks – all 
critical elements of equitable access to eye 
health services. 
We supported key partnerships during the 
year. These included the Collaborative on 
Strategic Public Private Partnerships for 
Cardiovascular Health  with Harvard Univer -
sity and the World Economic Forum to 
strengthen the capacity of health systems to 
detect, treat and ultimately prevent athero -
sclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), which accounts for over 85% of all cardio -
vascular disease deaths. In the US, we 
expanded our Beacon of Hope program, 
which funds research at historically Black 
medical colleges into how to tackle dispari -
ties endemic in the US health system (see 
page 58 ).
The data table below covers HSS activities 
in LMICs managed by the Novartis Global 
Health organization. In 2022, we increased 
the number of people reached despite fewer 
points of service provision and standalone 
awareness events, due primarily to our 
focus on maximizing the efficiency of these 
activities. The ongoing impact of the COVID-
19 pandemic in some countries also limited 
the number of community engagements 
during the year.At the same time, we continued to expand 
our emerging market brands (EMB) pro -
gram, adding 29 new EMBs including for 
Leqvio , Piqray  and Kesimpta . We also 
continue to narrow or eliminate the time lag 
between launches in Europe and in other 
countries. For instance, during 2022 we 
launched an EMB of our lung cancer treat -
ment Tabrecta  in Malaysia two months 
before the first EU launch in Germany.
Through our donation programs, we help 
broaden access to patients in LMICs with 
serious or life-threatening illnesses and 
those affected by natural disasters and 
extreme poverty. In 2022, we expanded our 
20-year collaboration with the Max Founda -
tion to include donations of our Kisqali  and 
Femara  medicines for breast cancer – 
a leading cause of cancer-related deaths 
among women in LMICs. The expanded 
program, known as CancerPathtoCareTM, 
will also continue to support patients with 
chronic myeloid leukemia and other rare 
cancers through donations of our Glivec , 
Tasigna  and Scemblix  medicines.

APPENDICES57 Novartis in Society Integrated Report |T aking action on health equity in the US
In 2022, we committed an additional USD 17.7 million to our Beacon 
of Hope initiative in the US to tackle racial health disparities, bringing 
total funding to more than USD 50 million over ten years. Beacon of 
Hope aims to address factors that disproportionately affect health in 
underserved communities by increasing diversity in clinical trials, 
reversing bias in data standards, and enabling the next generation of 
African American, Black and Hispanic healthcare leaders. 
The additional funds are being used to create Clinical Trial Centers 
of Excellence at three historically Black medical colleges and 
universities (HBCUs) – Howard University College of Medicine, 
Meharry Medical College and Charles R. Drew University of Medi-
cine and Science – in addition to the centers at the Morehouse 
School of Medicine, which were announced in 2021.  
As part of the initiative, NIBR is offering a 10-week paid summer 
fellowship program for students at HBCUs to learn drug discovery, 
data analytics and clinical research practices, with the goal of 
training up to 250 scientific leaders over 10 years. 
Beacon of Hope brings together Novartis, the Novartis US Founda-
tion, the Morehouse School of Medicine, the Thurgood Marshall 
College Fund, Coursera, the National Medical Association, and 
26 HBCUs in the US.  In addition, two other global pharmaceutical 
companies joined the collaboration in 2022.

more information about our work on AMR.  Act4Biosimilars
In May, our Sandoz division founded and 
sponsored a new global initiative called 
Act4Biosimilars to increase access to 
bio lo gics. Bringing together patient advo -
cates, healthcare professionals and industry 
leaders, Act4Biosimilars is aimed at increas -
ing global adoption of biosimilars by at least 
30% in more than 30 countries by 2030. 
Biosimilars tend to cost much less than 
branded medicines, which makes them 
more affordable for those on low incomes. 
Sandoz already systematically considers 
access when pricing generics and biosimi -
lars, typically entering a market at below  
the reference price. Sandoz medicines 
reached approximately 450 million patients 
worldwide in 2022.
Fighting antimicrobial resistance
The WHO has declared antimicrobial 
resistance (AMR) – when antibiotics and 
other antimicrobial medicines become 
ineffective and infections become increas -
ingly difficult or impossible to treat – a major 
public health threat. AMR causes nearly 1.3 
million deaths a year, as many as HIV and 
malaria combined, according to the Global 
Research on Antimicrobial Resistance 
report published in 2022. 
Novartis supports the global scientific con -
sensus that overuse, underuse and misuse of 
antimicrobial medicines all contribute to the 
spread of AMR, and that a balanced 
approach is needed. Our approach to 
tackling AMR focuses on four areas:

APPENDICES58|Integrated access in action: sickle cell disease (SCD) in Africa
The Novartis Africa Sickle Cell program provides a blueprint for how to 
address access barriers across the continuum of care.  Launched in 
2019, the program takes an end-to-end approach to tackling the disease 
in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), from research into new medicines to efforts 
to break down barriers to diagnosis and treatment.
• R&D: While the genetic cause of SCD has been known for decades, it’s 
only recently that the medical world has gained the tools to potentially fix 
the errant gene that causes the disease. Together with the Bill & Melinda 
Gates Foundation, we are exploring the possibility of a novel in vivo gene 
therapy for SCD, offering hope of a cure for the disease. We envision 
developing an accessible therapy that could potentially be administered 
directly to the patient through a single injection. This contrasts with 
complex procedures associated with ex vivo gene therapies that require 
cells to be extracted from the body and are individually manufactured 
before treatment.
• Availability of existing treatments: We continue to roll out hydroxyurea 
across the continent. The medicine has been shown to improve health 
outcomes among those living with SCD. In 2022, we launched a pediat -
ric-friendly formulation of hydroxyurea in Ghana, with plans to expand to 
Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda in 2023. Building on that, we are assessing 
the opportunity to introduce innovative therapies for SCD. 
• Health system strengthening: We are working to strengthen early 
intervention in SCD treatment, particularly among young children. Our 
new partnership with the American Society of Hematology, agreed in 
2022, will improve screening and diagnosis at health institutions in seven 
SSA countries.80%

APPENDICES59 Novartis in Society Integrated Report |Maintaining high ethical standards
Our industry faces ethical questions and 
decisions every day on issues such as 
patient care, data use, and access to 
medicines. To guide us in these decisions, 
we have a comprehensive Code of Ethics – 
developed together with our employees and 
experts in behavioral science – that applies 
to all employees, as well as a suite of 
internal policies and controls. We also 
provide online tools, such as the Ethical 
Decision Explorer, to help employees 
navigate ethical dilemmas, in addition to 
training on ethics to employees at all levels 
of the company. In 2022, 98% of employees 
completed training on our Code of Ethics . 
In addition, our ethical standards are built 
into our relations with business partners via 
our Third Party Code and we have programs 
in place to combat falsified medicines and 
monitor potential adverse effects of our 
medicines (see page 44 ). 
We also work through industry codes, 
including PhRMA’s Code on Interactions 
with Health Care Professionals and the 
IFPMA’s Code on Pharmaceutical Marketing 
Practices, as well through as regional and 
local industry associations. The UN Conven -
tion Against Corruption and the OECD’s 
Convention on Combating Bribery of 
Foreign Public Officers inform our policies 
and programs. We are a signatory to the UN 
Global Compact and we are working to 
implement the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. You can read 
more about our approach to ethics, risk and 
compliance on pages 68-75 .
Encouraging employees to speak up
The Novartis SpeakUp Office, our grievance 
mechanism, enables employees and exter -
nal parties to raise concerns about potential 
misconduct while being protected against 
retaliation.
In 2022, a total of 2 569 complaints of 
alleged misconduct, resulting in 2 400 
cases with 2 871 allegations, were received 
and handled. Of the total cases, 385 (16%) 
were classified as central matters (high -
er-risk cases) warranting further investiga -
tion. Lower-risk matters are addressed or 
investigated locally. The investigated central 
matter allegations resulted in 116 dismissals 
or resignations, and in 62 written warnings. 
Other remedial actions such as training, 
coaching and implementing new controls 
were also used when deemed appropriate. 
The increase in cases from the prior year 
was primarily due to matters related to data 
security as a result of enhanced protective 
measures and monitoring systems the 
company put in place. These measures 
included a campaign on data loss prevention 
to support regular mandatory trainings on 
information management, data privacy and 
data use. The increase in reported cases 
indicates that our SpeakUp program and 
related awareness activities are having an impact in encouraging people to raise their 
concerns.
Measuring our ethical climate
In 2022, we conducted our second global 
ethics survey to gather data on ethical 
behavior and the ethical climate across our 
company. We received more than 33 000 
responses. We use insights from the survey 
to drive conversations at the global and local levels and take action where needed. 
For example, in 2022 we further clarified our 
commitment to protect employees who 
speak up from disciplinary action in a new 
standalone policy on non-retaliation, which 
was created in consultation with our human 
rights and employee relations teams. We 
intend to continue running the global ethics 
survey in 2023.

APPENDICES60 Novartis in Society Integrated Report |Helping those affected by the war in Ukraine
We provided support to refugees and those displaced by the war in Ukraine. 
We also provided essential medical supplies and continued to deliver our 
medicines to patients who need them.
• Since the start of the war, we have provided 21 million doses of medicine 
to those in Ukraine and to refugees in border areas, worth more than 
USD 33 million. 
• We donated USD 3 million to organizations working with refugees and 
displaced people, including Save the Children, the International Rescue 
Committee and the Red Cross, and allocated a further USD 1 million to 
patient organizations supporting displaced refugees. 
• Novartis employees donated more than USD 2.2 million to non-profit 
organizations through employee giving. Beyond donations, our  
employees also volunteered their time and skills and opened their 
homes to host refugees. 
To protect employees, we suspended our operations in Ukraine in  
March. After studying safety protocols in the country, we resumed business 
operations remotely in June to help the country restore some basic critical 
business processes. We continue to review and adapt our activities to 
the prevailing security and safety situation. Protecting employees remains 
our priority.
In Russia, we took measures to freeze capital investment, advertising and 
other promotional activities. We also stopped new clinical trials and 
suspended enrollments in existing trials. We continue, however, to supply 
vital medicines to patients in Russia. We will keep measures affecting 
both Ukraine and Russia under review. 21 m

Integrated ReportStrong corporate governance is vital for the effective management of our business and is the cornerstone of trust in 
Novartis. Our system of governance – along with our internal policies and controls – is aimed at ensuring we comply 
with applicable laws and regulations and meet high ethical standards. In doing so, it supports long-term value 
creation for shareholders, patients, employees and other stakeholders. For more detailed information on corporate 
governance at Novartis, please refer to our 2022 Annual Report . 
Our system of corporate 
governance
Our corporate governance is based on an 
effective system of checks and balances. 
We have a three-tier governance structure, 
which comprises the Annual General 
Meeting (AGM) of shareholders, our Board 
of Directors and the Executive Committee of 
Novartis (ECN): 
• Shareholders  approve dividend payments, 
compensation for members of the Board 
and ECN, as well as financial statements 
and other disclosures. They also elect the 
Board Chair, members of the Board of 
Directors, members of the Board’s Com -
pensation Committee, the Independent 
Proxy and external auditor. Shareholders 
meet at least once a year, usually in 
February or March. 
• Our Board of Directors  has ultimate 
decision-making authority (for those 
decisions not reserved for shareholders). 
The Board operates through five perma -
nent committees: Audit and Compliance; 
Compensation; Governance, Sustainability 
and Nomination; Risk; and Science and 
Technology. The Board represents the 
interests of all stakeholders and oversees 
the work of the ECN.• The ECN  is led by the Chief Executive 
Officer (CEO) and is responsible for opera -
tional management, including financial per -
formance and fulfilment of the company’s 
purpose, strategic priorities and targets. The 
ECN has 11 members, including the CEO and 
Chief Financial Officer, as well as the lead -
ers of our commercial divisions, research 
and development organizations, Opera -
tions and other functions (see page 67 ).
In addition, our external auditor provides 
regular opinions to management and 
shareholders on the company’s compliance 
with applicable standards, laws and report -
ing regulations. 
Composition of the Board
All Board members are independent and 
non-executive, as defined under our Board 
regulations. Members are elected for one year 
only; they may serve a maximum of 12 years1. 
When choosing new members, the Board 
aims for a balance of skills, expertise and 
experience. Almost all current Board 
members have experience in leadership and 
management. Six have experience in Corporate governance 
1 An exception to this rule was made in 2021 for Andreas von Planta. To 
ensure an orderly transition, Mr. von Planta was granted an exception

governance 
At Board level, the Governance, Sustainabil -
ity and Nomination Committee (GSNC) 
oversees performance regarding gover -
nance and ESG matters, including access to 
medicines, global health, environmental 
sustainability, and human capital manage -
ment. The GSNC also discusses emerging 
trends and regularly advises the Board on 
ESG matters. 
The ECN oversees operational manage -
ment of ESG issues. The ECN-level ESG 
Committee, chaired by the CEO, meets 
every two months to review ESG perfor -
mance and strategy.
The Board-level Science & Technology 
Committee is responsible for oversight and 
evaluation of the performance of the 
company’s scientific, technological and R&D 
activities. At the management level, the 
Innovation Management Board (IMB) is 
responsible for strategic aspects of our 
development portfolio, including the 
endorsement of development project priorities and decisions on project discon -
tinuations. Our CEO chairs the IMB. Other 
representatives from Novartis senior 
management are among its core and 
extended membership.
Our Sustainability & ESG Office, part of our 
Global Health and Sustainability organiza -
tion, is responsible for embedding ESG 
management across our business. ESG 
issues are integrated into our Enterprise 
Risk Management approach. In addition, we 
have internal policies and controls to 
minimize risk in areas such as human rights, 
health and safety, anti-bribery and corrup -
tion. Stakeholder engagement also plays an 
important role in helping us identify possible 
ESG risks and opportunities (see page 21 ). 
For example, we have an independent 
Bioethics Advisory Committee, which 
advises management on ethical issues 
related to our research, drug development 
and access programs.

Compensation Report
APPENDICEST o meet the expectations society has of our industry, we strive to maintain high ethical standards, 
manage risk effectively and ensure we comply with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, we work 
to uphold human rights and reduce social and environmental risk throughout our value chain. T o support 
our approach, we encourage employees to take personal accountability for their decisions.
Our Code of Ethics
The healthcare industry deals with ethical 
questions every day – for example on 
affordability and access to medicines, or how 
to protect patients’ sensitive personal data. 
Many of these issues go to the heart of our 
strategy as a focused medicines company. 
Our approach to managing ethical decisions 
is based on our Code of Ethics , which applies 
to all Novartis employees. This Code sets 
out commitments in 23 areas that are 
applicable across our business, codifying 
who we are, what we stand for and the 
principles to which we hold ourselves 
accountable. We conduct an annual global 
ethics survey to measure our progress in 
embedding our Code across our organi -
zation (see page 60 ).
Managing risk
Our strategy as a focused medicines 
company creates both opportunities and 
risks for our business. Many of these risks 
relate to our business environment, such as 
the uncertainty inherent in research and 
development or increasing societal expecta -
tions of our industry. Effectively managing 
these risks is critical to achieving our 
strategic goals and creating value for our 
stakeholders and society.Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
framework is designed to generate a holistic 
view of risks for the company and drive a 
culture of smart risk-taking. It ensures that 
effective risk management is integrated into 
our significant activities and helps us better 
understand our risk exposure by providing 
increased transparency for leaders on how 
our key threats and opportunities are 
evolving throughout the year.
Our annual ERM process results in the 
Novartis Risk Compass, which helps our Board of Directors and senior management 
focus on key risks and align strategy with 
risk exposure. 
Risks are grouped into three categories: 
strategic, operational and emerging. Risks 
are rated on a four-point scale – very high, 
high, medium, low – based on their likeli -
hood and potential impact, using the 
‘most-probable worst-case’ scenario  
for each risk as a reference point. Once  
key risks are identified, mitigation plans  
are created.
Strategic risks
are the most consequential to our ability to 
execute our strategy or achieve our 
business objectives.Operational risks
relate to internal processes or 
systems, employee errors or 
external events.
Emerging risks
require close monitoring and have the potential to 
become strategic or operational risks.Awareness topics
are longer-term trending topics that have 
the potential to become new risks.Novartis Risk CompassRelated links and disclosures

APPENDICESIn addition to the three categories described 
above, we identify separate “awareness 
topics” that we believe may become new 
risks over time. Awareness topics are not 
rated. We regularly monitor risks and revise 
our assessments, if necessary. 
Risk governance
The effectiveness of risk management 
depends on its integration into the 
 governance of the organization, including 
strategy-  setting and decision-making. This 
requires involvement and support from 
management and governance bodies at 
different levels of the company:
• The Risk Committee of the Board of 
Directors oversees the risk management 
system and processes within Novartis. 
Together with senior management, this 
body revises the prioritization of risks, the 
risk portfolio and actions implemented by 
management, and performs ad hoc 
reviews of key risk areas. 
• The ECN regularly assesses risks and 
fosters a culture of risk awareness, in line 
with the Novartis Values and Behaviors 
and the Novartis Code of Ethics. The 
overall ERM process is the responsibility 
of the Chief Ethics, Risk & Compliance 
Officer. The CEO reviews and validates the 
annual Novartis risk portfolio, while 
members of the ECN are appointed as risk 
owners for relevant strategic risks.• These bodies are supported by the Risk & 
Resilience organization, which is part of 
the Ethics, Risk & Compliance (ERC) 
function and manages the ERM process, 
as well as risk leaders from key markets 
and functions. 
Risks in 2022
Our risk portfolio in 2022 comprises 16 
risks. Of these, six are categorized as 
strategic, seven as operational and the 
remaining three as emerging. In addition, we 
have identified two awareness topics. 
Changes in our external environ -
ment have exacerbated some 
risks and given rise to new ones
While the majority of risks remain the same 
as in 2021, changes in our external environ -
ment over the past year – such as the war in 
Ukraine and an increasingly negative global 
macroeconomic outlook – have exacerbated 
some risks and given rise to new ones. In 
addition, the decisions to spin off our 
Sandoz Division and transform our organiza -
tional structure have influenced our risk 
portfolio due to the significant nature of 
these changes.69 Novartis in Society Integrated Report |

Deliver high-value medicines  
T  Key products and commercial 
priorities 
Failure to deliver key commercial 
priorities and successfully launch 
new productsOur ability to grow our business depends on the commercial success of key products. Their 
success could be impacted by a number of factors, including pressure from new or existing 
competitive products; changes in the prescribing habits of healthcare professionals; 
unexpected side effects or safety signals; supply chain issues or other product shortages; 
pricing pressures; regulatory proceedings; changes in labeling; loss of intellectual property 
protection; and global pandemics. •  We are focusing our commercial strategy on eight priority brands / launch 
assets across five core therapeutic areas, as well as four priority 
geographies (US, Germany, China, Japan).
• We also continue to evolve our customer engagement model to combine 
traditional face-to-face visits with virtual engagements with healthcare 
professionals. We are similarly changing our approach to partnering with 
healthcare systems, payers and other healthcare providers.
T  Research and development
Failure to successfully prioritize, 
integrate and execute our 
research and development 
programs to develop new products 
or new indications for existing 
products, given our focus on 
innovative medicines We engage in costly, lengthy and uncertain R&D activities, both independently and in 
collaboration with third parties, to identify and develop new products and new indications for 
existing products. Failure can occur at any point, including after substantial investment. New 
products must undergo intensive preclinical and clinical testing. Further, regulatory 
authorities continue to establish new and increasingly rigorous requirements for approval 
and reimbursement. The post-approval regulatory burden has also increased.•  As with our commercial strategy, we have clear priorities in R&D. We focus 
on five technology platforms: two established platforms (chemistry and 
chemical biology; biotherapeutics) plus three advanced platforms (RNA 
therapy; radioligand therapy; gene and cell therapy).
• We seek to enter into agreements with other pharmaceutical and 
biotechnology companies and with academic and other institutions to 
develop new medicines.
• We are also accelerating the use of data science and digital technology to 
make the drug discovery and development process more efficient and 
effective.
Embed operational excellence
T  Alliances, acquisitions and 
divestments
Failure to identify, execute, and/or 
realize the expected benefits from 
our external business 
opportunities As part of our strategy, we acquire and divest products or entire businesses, and enter into 
strategic alliances and collaborations. This strategy depends in part on our ability to identify 
strategic opportunities, value them appropriately and competitively and close transactions 
with third parties. Efforts to develop and market acquired products, to integrate acquired 
businesses or to achieve expected synergies may fail or may not fully meet expectations. 
Also, our strategic alliances and collaborations with third parties may not achieve their 
intended goals and objectives.• We established a new Strategy and Growth function to help drive our 
growth strategy end-to-end, including establishing an enterprise-level 
business development and M&A strategy to help identify external 
opportunities that align with our strategy.
• We are also enhancing our due diligence approach, for example by 
strengthening risk assessments in areas such as advanced therapies.Strategic risks in focus

T Strategic transformations
Failure to meet organizational 
transformation programs 
objectives and/or unintended 
adverse impacts on our businessIn 2022, we announced a new organizational structure and operating model designed to 
support our innovation, growth, and productivity ambitions as a focused medicines company 
(Transforming for Growth). We also announced our intention to separate our Sandoz Division 
into a new publicly traded standalone company, by way of a 100% spin-off in order to 
maximize shareholder value. The significant nature of these organizational changes, and the 
additional workload and complexity for our employees in some areas, could potentially result 
in instability within the organization that may lead to failure to achieve the desired benefits. • We established a dedicated transformation team for Transforming for 
Growth, which reports to our Executive Committee, while also putting in 
place measures to help employees and leaders manage through this 
significant reorganization of our business. 
• Ahead of the proposed Sandoz spin-off, we are working to strengthen 
Sandoz’s capabilities in functions that are currently shared and begin the 
separation of function- country- or site-level dynamics. Sandoz is also 
considering plans to strengthen its development and manufacturing 
capabilities.
Strengthen our foundations
T  Pricing, reimbursement and 
access
Pricing and reimbursement 
pressure, including pricing 
transparency and access to 
healthcareWe experience increasing pressure on our ability to obtain and maintain satisfactory rates of 
reimbursement from governments, insurers and other payers. These pressures have many 
sources, including rising healthcare costs (exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic); funding 
restrictions and policy changes; and public controversies, debate, investigations and legal 
proceedings around pharmaceutical pricing. Such pressures may impact product pricing and 
market access. We also face price controls and other measures imposed by governments 
and other payers. In addition, our Sandoz Division faces continued price erosion in the 
generics and biosimilars segment. • We are increasing efforts to enable patient access through innovative 
pricing and access initiatives in the US, Europe and other markets, including 
contract structures such as pay-over-time and outcome-based agreements. 
• We also continue to execute against access-to-medicine and global health 
targets. These targets are backed by a sustainability-linked bond, which 
embeds them into the core of our business operations.
T  Environmental, social and 
governance matters
Failure to meet environmental, 
social and governance 
expectationsAn inability to successfully perform on ESG matters may have negative effects on our 
recruitment and retention of employees, as well as on our operations, financial results, 
reputation, and/or share price. Examples include failing to meet our access-to-medicines 
commitments or ensuring that third parties in our value chain comply with ESG requirements. 
We may also fail to meet evolving ESG due diligence and reporting regulations.• We regularly review our ESG strategic roadmap to ensure commitments are 
on track and latest developments are incorporated. We also monitor ESG 
regulatory changes and set up internal governance and processes to be 
compliant with regulatory requirements.

APPENDICESProduct quality and patient safety
We have extensive policies, systems and 
controls in place to protect patient safety. 
These relate primarily to two areas: product 
quality and pharmacovigilance. 
To ensure product quality, we maintain a 
robust quality management system for our 
medicines in full compliance with require -
ments from health authorities and other 
regulators. We have manufacturing licenses 
and relevant ISO and Good Manufacturing 
Practice (GMP) certificates for all our 
manufacturing, medical devices, supply and 
distribution operations, issued after inspec -
tions by regulators such as the US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA), the European 
Medicines Agency (EMA), the Japanese 
Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices 
Agency (PMDA), the World Health Organiza -
tion (WHO) and Swissmedic. 
We conduct thorough investigations when -
ever there is any evidence of deviation from 
these standards, or if we detect failures in 
our manufacturing processes. We conduct 
comprehensive quality and safety training 
for employees and third parties. We require 
all employees involved in manufacturing, 
supply and distribution to attend at least 
two annual training sessions on quality 
standards. All third parties providing ser -
vices or goods manufactured to good 
practice standards are required to have Third-party risk assessments
We established a third-party risk management 
(TPRM) framework in 2019 to help identify and 
manage risks when interacting with third 
parties. In 2022, we extended our TPRM 
program to perform risk assessments on 
wholesalers and distributors in addition to 
vendors and suppliers. 
Our TPRM framework is supported by our 
Third Party Code , which we recently updated 
to specify human rights due diligence and 
environmental sustainability expectations from 
third parties. We have also introduced guides to 
help procurement teams buy more of our 
supplies from certified sources.
Novartis is a member of the Pharmaceutical 
Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI). Our Third Party 
Code is consistent with the PSCI’s principles 
for responsible supply chain management. 
Complying with laws, regulations 
and controls
We operate in a highly regulated industry. 
Making sure we comply with laws and 
regulations is important to secure the trust 
of both regulators and the wider public. 
We have a comprehensive compliance 
management system, developed in line with 
external standards (e.g., those issued by the 
OECD), which that helps us to prevent, 
detect and correct systemic misconduct. The aim of this system is to ensure compli -
ance not only with laws and regulations, but 
also with own internal policies and controls. 
In 2022, we conducted a review of our 
Compliance Evaluation Program, supported 
by an external non-profit organization 
focused on governance and anti-corruption. 
We conducted a review of our 
Compliance Evaluation Program, 
supported by an external non-
profit organization focused on 
governance and anti-corruption 
We work to detect and prevent misconduct. 
Where evidence of misconduct is found, we 
take swift and appropriate action. Our 
programs are supported by our SpeakUp 
Office, which allows employees and external 
parties to raise concerns about potential 
misconduct in confidence (see page 60 ). 
Anti-bribery policies and practices
Novartis does not tolerate any form of 
bribery and/or corruption. Our Anti-Bribery 
Policy , Professional Practices Policy  and 
Conflict of Interest Policy outline our expec -
tations for all employees. We also clearly set 
out our standards in our Code of Ethics . 
Bribery risks in our supply chain are 
addressed by our Third Party Code and 
Anti-Bribery Third Party Guideline . The Third Party Code is an integral part of every 
supplier contract.
Working with Norges Bank Investment 
Management (NBIM), we helped develop a 
reporting standard on anti-bribery for the 
pharmaceuticals industry. The resulting 
expectation document  issued by NBIM, 
which is based on principles such as the 
United Nations (UN) Global Compact and the 
OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enter -
prises, formed the basis of our first dedi -
cated anti-bribery report  published in early 
2022. We plan to report on a regular basis.
Internal Audit
Internal Audit assists the Board of Directors 
and the ECN by providing independent 
assurance and advice on the effectiveness, 
efficiency and adequacy of processes and 
controls that support Novartis in achieving 
its strategy, managing major risks, and 
ensuring compliance with applicable poli -
cies, laws and regulations. To ensure its 
independence, our Internal Audit sits out-   
side the ERC function; it works according to 
an audit plan approved by the Board’s Audit 
and Compliance Committee. During 2022, 
Internal Audit carried out 63 audits, reviews 
and advisories relating to both our own 
operations and our suppliers. These audits 
include the review of ethical standards.73 Novartis in Society Integrated Report |

APPENDICEStheir own quality assurance and formal 
training process. Furthermore, we are 
regularly audited on our training proce -
dures, and training is also included in our 
audits for third parties. 
Following regulatory guidance (including 
FDA and EMA recommendations) we 
monitor chemical and biological medicines 
for impurities, including those classified as 
“probable human carcinogens” (e.g., nitro -
samines). Any product identified with a 
potential risk undergoes further evaluation 
and risk management, with results submitted 
to the relevant health authorities as required.
Pharmacovigilance involves monitoring the 
safety of our drugs both during develop -
ment and in the commercial setting. This 
enables us to detect any adverse effects 
that may emerge at any stage of the drug’s 
lifecycle. In accordance with international 
regulations, we share periodic safety 
reports with the relevant health authorities 
and maintain current benefit-risk analyses 
for our medicines. 
We also support education programs for 
patients, providers and pharmacists, and 
provide regular training to employees in 
adverse event reporting. For some medi -
cines, post-approval studies may be con -
ducted to collect more data on possible 
long-term or adverse effects. Health, safety & environment (HSE)
We work to maintain a safe and healthy 
environment at all our facilities. To achieve 
this, we have an integrated HSE management 
system. Every year, we carry out a compre -
hensive assessment to ensure compliance 
with all relevant laws, regulations and 
internal standards. We also have extensive 
health and safety programs that cover a 
broad spectrum of work related hazards.
To monitor progress, we set annual HSE 
targets, investigate all safety incidents, 
including “near-misses” and encourage 
employees to report all incidents. Novartis 
sites are subject to inspection by health, 
safety and environmental regulators. In 
addition, we require sites to carry out 
regular self-assessments; a dedicated 
team conducts more focused audits on 
a 3- to 5-year cycle. 
We are also committed to protecting 
contractors’ safety: we assess outside 
contractors and make sure they have the right 
resources and procedures in place to be 
working at our sites. Supplier contracts 
include specific occupational health and 
safety criteria. 
Cybersecurity
As reflected in our Code of Ethics, we are 
committed to the responsible use of informa -
tion in our business processes, including 
personal information, and we adhere to 
appropriate standards to achieve this pur -
pose. We have robust governance, processes and policies in place to ensure the security of 
our data and IT systems.  All Novartis employ-
ees participate in annual mandatory training 
in information management. 
To prevent IT system interruptions, Novartis 
has risk-based services continuity and 
systems recovery plans in place, which are 
tested periodically. We also conduct ongo -
ing internal vulnerability analyses (including 
simulated hacking) as well as external 
testing via a third-party to ensure the 
effectiveness of our cybersecurity controls. 
We require employees to report IT security 
incidents to a Cyber Security Operations 
Center that operates 24 hours a day. 
Novartis has not experienced any material 
cybersecurity incidents in the three years 
through 2022.
Animal welfare
Animal research lies behind many recent 
medical advances, including cancer treat -
ments, vaccines and drugs to treat neuro -
logical diseases such as epilepsy, schizo -
phrenia and depression. It is a currently 
unavoidable part of medical science. Animal 
studies are also often required by health 
regulators to prove that medicines are safe 
and effective for humans. 
Our animal research is governed by our 
Animal Welfare Policy , updated in 2022. This 
policy applies to all Novartis-sponsored 
studies, whether internal or external. As part 
of the policy, we are committed to applying 
the 3 R’s rule – to reduce the number of animals needed in our studies, to refine study 
methods to minimize animals’ distress or 
pain and to replace animal studies with 
alternative options where possible. See 
page 84  for our 2022 animal research 
performance indicators.
In 2022, we recognized several award-winning 
projects that significantly advanced the 3Rs 
at Novartis, including one that replaced mice 
in rheumatoid arthritis studies with a novel 
human cell based in-vitro assay. We also 
launched a grant program to prospectively 
fund research projects to validate new 
alternatives to animal research, reduce animal 
numbers and improve the animals’ experience.
T ransparency and disclosure
We attach great importance to being 
transparent about our activities and perfor -
mance. In addition to our Annual Report and 
this Novartis in Society Integrated Report, 
we publish many of our internal policies, 
codes and guidelines, and provide quarterly 
updates on our financial and ESG perfor -
mance. We also disclose our progress against 
the UN Global Compact principles, as well 
as our payments to healthcare profession -
als and patient organizations, our political 
contributions and the results from our 
clinical trials. For more information, see 
our corporate website . 74 Novartis in Society Integrated Report |

APPENDICESUpholding our commitment  
to human rights
Over the years, we have worked to embed 
human rights in our business. In our Code of 
Ethics, we pledge to conduct our business 
in a manner that respects the rights and 
dignity of all people. In 2022, we updated 
our Human Rights Commitment Statement .
To ensure we live up to our commitments, 
we have a human rights management 
program, based on three pillars, aligned with 
the UN Guiding Principles on Business and 
Human Rights:
Due diligence 
We conduct ongoing human rights due 
diligence across our business. We also 
make sure we have policies and manage -
ment systems in place to support our 
commitments. Our suppliers and partners 
are regularly assessed and monitored 
against our Third Party Code and we 
collaborate with industry partners like the 
Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative on 
topic-specific supply chain projects such as 
conflict minerals and child labor. 
In 2022, we carried out an assessment of 
our global health program to assess compli -
ance with international human rights stan -
dards. This assessment applied to specific 
functions within our global health program 
and was based on the Human Rights Guidelines for Pharmaceutical Companies 
in relation to Access to Medicines, issued in 
2008 by the UN Special Rapporteur on the 
right to health. In addition, our human rights 
team worked with our pharmaceutical export 
business to conduct human rights risk 
assessments covering high-risk countries.
Empowerment
We work to provide access to effective 
grievance mechanisms for those who may 
have been affected by human rights abuses, 
primarily through our SpeakUp office. In 
2023, we plan to update our SpeakUp 
reporting tool to make the process of 
reporting a human rights grievance more 
accessible to third parties. We provide 
targeted training for employees in high-risk 
functions or locations – and raise aware -
ness throughout the Group regarding the 
importance of respecting human rights. 
Engagement
We engage with stakeholders to listen to 
their concerns, take collective action where 
it makes sense and regularly report our 
performance on human rights. We share 
actions taken to address the potential risk of 
conflict minerals, forced labor, child labor 
and other salient risks in our global supply 
chain through our annual UK and Australia 
Joint Modern Slavery Statement  and other 
public disclosures.Our human rights priorities
In 2022, we updated and streamlined our Human Rights Commitment 
Statement  to focus on four priority areas, each aligned with the Novartis 
Code of Ethics . Below, we provide links to key policies and commitments 
relevant to each focus area.

Compensation Report
APPENDICESIn 2022, we continued to make progress in transforming Novartis into a focused 
medicines company. Feedback received prior to our last Annual General Meeting 
(AGM) indicated that shareholders agreed our compensation system is aligned with 
our purpose, strategy and culture. 
2022 performance highlights
2022 was a year of solid financial perfor -
mance, with growth in constant currencies 
across sales, core profits and core margins. 
The performance was driven by key 
 in-market and launch products, including 
Entresto , Kesimpta , Kisqali,  Cosentyx , 
and Pluvicto . 
In April 2022, we announced the introduc -
tion of a new organizational model designed 
to support our next phase of innovation, 
growth, and productivity as a focused 
medicines company. The restructuring is 
expected to deliver USD 1.5 billion in savings 
by 2024. 
There was nonetheless an immediate impact 
on Operating Income that, along with 
unfavorable fair value adjustments on financial 
assets, impacted operating income growth. 
We continued to deliver high value medi -
cines to patients with 23 approvals, includ -
ing a novel radioligand therapy, Pluvicto , and 
24 submissions across our priority geogra -
phies. We also had several important clinical 
data readouts, for example, iptacopan for 
the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. However, we also had 
disappointments as some clinical trials 
of experimental compounds did not meet 
their primary endpoints, including ACZ885 
( canakinumab) in lung cancer, and UNR844 
in  presbyopia. 
Novartis also continued to deliver on its 
commitments to broaden access to medi -
cines and tackle major global health chal -
lenges. We pledged further investment for 
research into malaria and neglected tropical 
diseases, increased access to our innova -
tive medicines in low- and middle-income 
countries (LMICs) and formed new collabo -
rations to strengthen healthcare systems. 
Performance against incentive targets, 
combined with base salary and other benefits 
and pension, resulted in 2022 total realized 
compensation for the CEO of CHF 8 452 176. 
This is a reduction of 24.7% compared with 
2021, driven mainly by lower payout of the 
Long-Term Performance Plan (LTPP). More 
details on CEO performance and compensa -
tion are available in the Compensation Report  
of our 2022 Annual Report.Changes to Executive Committee 
compensation system and 
disclosures
During the year, we reviewed our Executive 
Committee compensation system, with 
the aim of simplification and increased 
transparency. 
Effective the 2022-2024 cycle of the LTPP, 
we strengthened the assessment of 
research and early development performance 
under the Innovation metrics, to ensure that 
targets are focused more directly on 
activities that create long-term value. From 
this cycle, the  Science & Technology 
Committee sets targets that take into 
account the expected Net Present Value 
(eNPV) of programs transitioning to late-
stage clinical development. 
Effective from performance year 2023, we 
will remove “Share of Peers” as a financial 
performance measure for the Annual 
Incentive plan. The weighting of the three 
remaining financial measures, Group Net 
Sales, Group Operating Income and Group 
Free Cash Flow, will be 40%, 30% and 30%, 
respectively. In addition, we will fold division 
specific financial targets, where applicable, 
into individual strategic objectives (40% 
weighting) of the related Executive Commit -tee member. All Executive Committee 
members will be evaluated, with a 60% 
weighting, against the performance of 
Group financial measures mentioned above.
During the year, we announced our intention to 
separate our Sandoz generics and biosimilars 
Division into a new publicly traded standalone 
company, by way of a 100% spin-off, subject 
to approval of the Novartis AG Board of 
Directors and shareholders. Based on the 
planned completion of the spin-off in 2023, 
the Compensation Committee made some 
initial decisions on the 2023 compensation 
elements related to the spin-off.
Alignment with company strategy
In 2022 we refocused our strategy to deliver 
high-value medicines that alleviate society’s 
greatest disease burdens through technol -
ogy leadership in research and develop -
ment, and novel access approaches. In line 
with this refocused strategy, we updated 
our strategic priorities to target innovation 
power, sales growth, delivering both margin 
and total shareholder returns, and sector 
leadership in material ESG factors. 
This resulted in some enhancements to the 
Annual Incentive plan and LTPP plans as 
explained earlier. Compensation Report 76 Novartis in Society Integrated Report |

to approve the maximum aggregate amount 
of compensation for the members of the 
Executive Committee of CHF 90 000 000. 
This is lower than the prior term, primarily 
due to the stepping down of the CEO, Sandoz 
from the Executive Committee. For the Board of Directors, the maximum aggregate 
amount proposed to shareholders is 
CHF 8 750 000, which is slightly higher than 
the prior term, due to change in committee

79|Our approach to reporting
The Novartis in Society Integrated Report is published annually. Its purpose is to provide an overview of our 
business, strategy and performance. Our full annual reporting suite, including our Annual Report and Form 20-F 
regulatory disclosures, can be found on our corporate website. 
Reporting principles
The Novartis in Society Integrated Report is 
intended for all Novartis stakeholders, but is 
primarily aimed at shareholders, investors and 
ESG analysts. 
The report has been prepared in alignment 
with the Integrated Reporting Framework, the 
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board 
(SASB) and the latest standards issued by 
the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). It also 
contains our main disclosures against the 
Recommendations from the Task Force for 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 
and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. 
In compiling this report, we also considered 
“Section Six: Transparency on Non-Financial 
Matters” under the Swiss Code of Obligations.
Scope

dated entities (in line with the Novartis Annual 
Report and 20-F). Annual performance data 
relates to the Group’s financial year (from 
January to December). Environmental data 
is based on January to September data, plus 
estimates for October to December. This 
data will be restated using twelve-month 
figures on our corporate website during 
2023. All information in this report reflects 
the continuing operations of Novartis Group, 
including various changes to the Group’s 
portfolio of activities in prior years. Content
• Selection of content was based primarily 
on our corporate strategy and results from 
our materiality assessment. 
• All content was subject to approval by  
the Novartis Board of Directors prior to 
publication. 
• An overview of definitions and methodolo -
gies for ESG performance indicators in 
the Novartis in Society Integrated Report 
2022 is available here . 
• Novartis financial data has been taken 
from our Annual Report, prepared in 
accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS), as issued by 
the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB). Novartis financial data is 
presented in US dollars (USD).
• Some figures have been rounded. Some 
percentages have also been calculated 
using rounded numbers. 
• Any material corrections or restatements 
are included in the text of this report. 
• A list of abbreviations can be found on 
page 95 .

1 Other than where indicated, environmental data for the current year are based on actuals for January-September and estimates for 
October-December (to be updated with actuals in 2023 in our annual Novartis Environmental Sustainability datasheet). Any significant 
deviations are restated the following year in the Novartis in Society Integrated Report. Previous years’ data reflect only actuals.
2 Using location based emission factors published in 2014 or 2015 depending on geography and data source. We plan to update the emission 
factors in the future reporting periods with the latest available ones.
3 Scope 3 emissions are reported in accordance with the GHG Protocol. Only the Scope 3 categories which are assured are separately 
disclosed. The total scope 3 emissions figure includes all categories. Our Scope 3 emissions increased by 20% from the prior year, driven 
primarily by purchased goods and services and, to a smaller extent, by increased business travel following the pandemic
4 Data includes indirect emissions from air travel, train travel, car rentals and hotel stays. The indicator is calculated using 12-month actual data.
5 For all disclosed years, the calculation for our inhalers is based on the IPCC 2015 GHG emission factor and assumes all hydrofluorocarbon 
(HFC) gas used in the production process is released upon use of the inhalers. We are in the process of determining if a portion of this gas is 
released during manufacturing and whether a portion also remains in the inhaler after its use, which would therefore need to be excluded from 
our calculation of Scope 3 use of sold products emissions.
6 Carbon offsets are based on data provided by third parties. For further details, please see our Reporting Criteria document .
7 Water withdrawals includes water used for cooling and returned to the environment without the need for additional treatment
8 Water consumption and non-contact water withdrawn from the environment for cooling and returned directly to the environment after use.
9 Water discharged via treatment and water lost

Executive Committee of Novartis (ECN) 
Several Novartis Board members have 
competence on ESG issues. We assess 
Board-level competence through criteria that 
include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• Whether the respective Board member has 
comprehensive/expert understanding of 
ESG-related issues 
• Whether the respective Board member has 
led a company/organization to adopt ESG 
goals or shape external sustainability 
leadership initiatives
For more information on the composition 
and expertise of the Novartis Board, please 
see our Annual Report .Novartis supports the recommendations of 
the Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD). This is our third TCFD 
disclosure. It is based on updated TCFD 
guidelines published in October 2021.  
We are committed to reducing the impact  
of our business activities on the environ -
ment, and have set clear targets covering 
climate, water and waste (see page 45 ). 
These targets relate to both our own 
manu facturing operations and to our wider 
supply chain. 
In 2022, we carried out an in-depth assess -
ment of the company’s climate-related risks 
and opportunities. The results form the 
basis of this disclosure. While we believe our 
business strategy is well-adapted to current 
climate risks and opportunities, we continue 
to work to improve our approach where pos -
sible, particularly as it relates to risk man -
agement and governance of climate issues.
Governance
Board oversight
Ultimate responsibility for our climate 
strategy lies with the Novartis Board of 
Directors. The Board has delegated primary 
responsibility for climate strategy and 
governance, including progress on metrics 
and targets, to the Governance, Sustainabil -
ity and Nomination Committee (GSNC). 
Climate-related topics were on the agenda 
at two out of three GSNC meetings in 2022.Management oversight
The ECN, led by the Chief Executive Officer 
(CEO), is responsible for implementing the 
company’s climate strategy. 
Environmental sustainability is included in the 
CEO’s Balanced Scorecard under the 
“Strategic Objectives” component, which is 
weighted at 40% of the annual incentive. 
Performance measures for other members of 
the ECN include emissions reductions targets 
where relevant for their area of responsibility.
The CEO chairs our ESG Committee, which 
oversees the company’s ESG strategy, 
including progress against our climate, water 
and waste targets. The ESG Committee 
meets every two months. Climate is included 
as a specific agenda item at least once a year. 
In 2022, it was discussed two times.The Chief Ethics, Risk & Compliance Officer 
(CERCO) is responsible for ensuring climate 
risk is fully integrated into our Enterprise Risk 
Management (ERM) processes. The CERCO 
reports quarterly to the Risk Committee, 
including on climate-related physical and 
transition risks as appropriate.
The President, Global Health & Sustainabil -
ity, is responsible for integrating ESG 
matters into the company’s business. The 
President, Operations, is responsible for 
leading the delivery of environmental 
sustainability targets.
An annual climate scenario analysis is carried 
out by the Environmental Sustainability 
Operations team, which updates both the 
ESG Committee and the Board at least once 
a year. Novartis also has an ESG Council and 
a Sustainability & ESG Office to further 
embed ESG priorities across the business.T ask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)

89 Novartis in Society Integrated Report |Strategy
Climate issues are integrated into our 
strategy, business model and financial 
planning process. Environmental sustain -
ability spans two of our strategic priorities: 
‘Embed operational excellence’ and ‘Build 
trust with society’1. It is also included in our 
materiality assessment (see pages 15, 41 
and 54 ). 
Financial planning 
All capital projects over USD 20 million 
require a formal Environmental Impact 
Assessment (EIA) to determine possible 
impact on the climate and/or company 
exposure to climate risks.  We also apply an 
internal shadow carbon price of USD 100 
per metric ton in our strategic decision- 
making and financial planning. 
In 2022, Novartis deployed approximately 
USD 30 million in capital expenditure 
on environmental projects to reduce con -
sumption of natural resources, improve 
energy efficiency and adopt renewable 
energy solutions across our operations.
Material climate-related issues
Results from our 2022 scenario analysis 
show that: a) climate change potentially 
presents both risks and opportunities for 
Novartis, and b) the company’s current 
strategy and financial position remain resilient 
to the possible impact of climate change.  To conduct our analysis, we used the 
scenarios listed on page 91 , based on input 
from both the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC) and the International 
Energy Agency (IEA). All risks and opportuni -
ties were assessed on a short-, medium- and 
long-term basis, in line with TCFD guidance.
Financial quantification
When assessing risks, including climate-  
related risks, Novartis defines the financial 
impact as the potential loss of annual sales, 
trade receivables or market share according 
to the following thresholds: <1% (insignificant); 
1–2% (minor); 2–3% (moderate); 3–5% 
(major); and >5% (severe). 
Results of 2022 scenario analysis
Our scenario analysis covered eight physical 
risks and thirteen transition risks and/or 
opportunities. Only the most significant items 
were carried forward for further quantitative 
analysis. These are set out in the table on 
page 91 . For purposes of comparison, 
impact is shown for the 2030 and 2050 
time horizons only. Please note the physical 
and transition risks identified below all fall 
within the “insignificant” level of financial 
impact (i.e., less than 1% loss of annual 
sales, trade receivables or market share).
1 For reporting purposes, we cover the topic under “Embed operational 
excellence” on page 44                For people in Djobel in northern Guin-
ea-Bissau, an increasingly severe rainy season 
makes the 12-kilometer journey to the nearest 
health center even more difficult.

Carbon 
priceInsignificant Carbon prices are likely to 
increase further across 
major operating countries. 
This may increase our 
future operating costs. USD 4–22 
million in 
additional 
annual carbon 
costsUSD 5–53 
million in 
additional 
annual carbon 
costsReducing emissions as part of 
our environmental sustainability 
targets will limit exposure to 
carbon pricing.
Net-zero 
healthcare  
systemsInsignificant Requirements to rapidly 
decarbonize may drive up 
capital expenditure (while 
failure to decarbonize may 
threaten the company’s 
license to operate in 
certain countries).USD 26–873 million in annual 
revenue classi  fied as “at risk” 3  
(i.e. related to markets with 
more ambitious net-zero targets 
than Novartis). For the most part, our net-zero 
targets are aligned with health 
system goals. In our key markets 
our net-zero commitment will 
require us to decarbonize at a 
faster rate than required. “At risk” 
revenues relate to a relatively 
small, low-footprint region. 
Circular 
economyInsignificant We may face potential 
increases in operating 
costs driven by higher 
plastic prices/ taxation 
imposed by countries. 
However, this is also an 
opportunity for Novartis to 
switch away from “virgin” 
(non-recycled) plastic USD 21–60 
million in 
savings 4 (from 
avoidance of 
increasing 
plastic costs)USD 10–120 
million in 
savings 4 (from 
avoidance of 
increasing 
plastic costs)We will reduce exposure to 
prices as we move closer to our 
plastic-neutral goal, particularly in 
advanced economies where plastic 
is being phased out or replaced 
by recycled materials. Risk will 
be entirely mitigated by 2030 if 
company goals are met.
Energy 
sourceInsignificant Impact of rising fossil fuel 
prices may be avoided by 
switching to more 
sustainable sources 
(particularly in replacing 
natural gas for heating 
with electricity).USD 70–230 
million in 
annual savings 
(by reducing 
proportional 
use of natural 
gas for heating)USD 80–320 
million in 
annual savings 
(by reducing 
proportional 
use of natural 
gas for heating)We will minimize exposure by 
increasing our use of clean energy 
in heating and other infrastructure 
investments.Tropical 
cyclonesInsignificant Potential financial 
implications through 
interruptions at our sites 
(e.g., property damage, 
equipment repairs) or via 
disruption to transport 
networks (e.g., delaying  
delivery of raw materials 
to sites or finished 
products)USD 16–18 
million USD 25–43 
million 
Flooding Insignificant Flooding could lead to 
disruption or delays in 
manufacturing processes 
(e.g. through property and 
infrastructure damage or 
repairs, fresh-water 
availability etc.) and 
interruptions in product 
distribution.USD 70–80 
million USD 35–95 
million 
Extreme 
heatInsignificant Extreme heat conditions 
could increase operating 
costs by augmenting our 
cooling needs and energy 
consumption to ensure 
processes and equipment 
operate efficiently. USD 6–10 
million USD 9–19 
million 
Water 
stress and 
drought2Insignificant Water stress and drought 
could potentially impact 
our operating costs 
through higher water 
prices, and/or a need to 
source water from 
alternative suppliers. This 
may also impact revenue 
by reducing efficiency or

91 Novartis in Society Integrated Report |Risk management 
In addition to our scenario analysis, climate 
risks are also in scope of our Enterprise 
Risk Management (ERM) framework, 
which ensures a consistent approach to 
risk assessment and treatment across 
our business.   
Risks are identified through annual risk 
workshops and periodically reviewed. 
Our Sustainability & ESG Office takes part in this process to ensure environmental 
and climate risks are considered. 
The outcomes are consolidated into the 
Novartis Risk Compass, which is a categori -
zation and visualization of Novartis top 
risks by grouping them into Strategic Risks, 
Operational Risks, Emerging Risks and 
Awareness Topics, comprising a selection 
of the top three items for each category 
(see page 68 ). Climate is captured primarily 
under the following two risks:   • Environmental, social and governance 
matters: a strategic risk defined as failure 
to meet environmental, social and gover -
nance expectations
• Climate change: an emerging risk defined 
as impact of climate change and increased 
risk of major natural disasters
Risks are assessed based on their potential 
impact and likelihood over the next five 
years, using the “most probable worst-case” 
scenario as a reference point. These are the 
same criteria used for other enterprise risks. 
To ensure alignment, our scenario analysis 
applies similar definitions for likelihood 
and impact. Senior managers across the 
business also provide input as part of our 
risk assessment. We take measures to avoid risks or reduce 
the risk exposure, where appropriate; these 
measures are determined by our risk appetite. 
We continually monitor risk and, if needed, 
periodically review our assessment and/or 
measures to be taken. The table below 
summarizes the outcome of our 2022 risk 
assessment for our two climate-related risks.
In 2023, we will explore ways of further 
integrating the scenario analysis into our 
ERM framework.
Metrics & targets
We use various climate-related metrics and 
set targets relating to carbon emissions, 
water consumption, waste, and plastic use. 
See page 82  for a list of our metrics and 
page 45  for details of our environmental 
sustainability targets.

92 Novartis in Society Integrated Report |Independent limited assurance report  
on selected Sustainability Information of Novartis AG
T o the Board of Directors of Novartis AG
We have undertaken a limited assurance engagement on Novartis AG’s (hereinafter 
“ Novartis”) Sustainability Information on pages 81 to 84 in the Novartis in Society 
 Integrated Report (the Report) for the year ended 31 December 2022 (hereinafter 
“ Sustainability Information”). 
Our assurance engagement does not extend to information in respect of earlier periods 
or to any other information included in the Report, the Novartis Annual Report, Form 20-F 
or displayed elsewhere on Novartis’s website for the current year or for previous periods 
unless otherwise indicated, including any images, audio files or embedded videos.
Our Limited Assurance Conclusion
Based on the procedures we have performed as described under the ‘Summary of the 
work we performed as the basis for our assurance conclusion’ and the evidence we have 
obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Sustainability 
Information in the Report for the year ended 31 December 2022 is not prepared, in all material 
respects, in accordance with the reporting criteria  as included here  ( Reporting Criteria).
We do not express an assurance conclusion on information in respect of earlier periods or 
to any other information included in the Report, the Novartis Annual Report or Form 20-F, 
including any images, audio files or embedded videos.
Understanding how Novartis has Prepared the Sustainability Information
The Reporting Criteria have been used as criteria references for the disclosures. Conse -
quently, the Sustainability Information needs to be read and understood together with the 
Reporting Criteria.
Inherent Limitations in Preparing the Sustainability Information
Due to the inherent limitations of any internal control structure, it is possible that errors or 
irregularities may occur in disclosures of the Sustainability Information and not be detected. 
Our engagement is not designed to detect all internal control weaknesses in the preparation 
of the Sustainability Information because the engagement was not performed on a continuous 
basis throughout the period and the assurance procedures performed were on a test basis.The nature of non-financial information; the absence of a significant body of established 
practice on which to draw; and the methods and precision used to determine non-financial 
information, allow for different, but acceptable evaluation and measurement techniques and 
can result in materially different measurements, affecting comparability between entities 
and over time. The Reporting Criteria have been developed to assist Novartis in its purpose 
in producing the Report. As a result, the Sustainability Information may not be suitable for 
another purpose. 
The Report includes a deduction from Novartis’s emissions for the year ended 
31  December 2022 of 30.7 (‘000 tCO 2 emissions) relating to offsets. The offsets are 
derived from  Novartis’s forestry projects and Novartis has engaged an external provider 
to calculate the amount of CO 2 emissions sequestered. We have performed procedures 
as to whether these sequestered CO 2 emissions relate to the current period, and whether 
the description of them in the Report and Reporting Criteria is inconsistent with the related 
documentation and calculations from the external provider. We have not, however, performed 
any procedures regarding the assumptions used in the calculation methodology for these 
offsets by the external provider, and express no opinion about whether the offsets have 
resulted, or will result, in a reduction of 30.7 (‘000 tCO 2 emissions). 
Novartis’s Responsibilities
The Board of Directors of Novartis is responsible for:
- Selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the Sustainability Information, 
taking into account applicable law and regulations related to reporting the Sustainability 
Information;
- The preparation of the Sustainability Information that is free from material misstatement 
in accordance with the Reporting Criteria;
- Designing, implementing and maintaining internal control over information relevant to the 
preparation of the Sustainability Information that is free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error; and
- The contents and statements contained within the Report and the Reporting Criteria.

93 Novartis in Society Integrated Report |Our Responsibilities
We are responsible for:
- Planning and performing the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether 
the Sustainability Information is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error;
- Forming an independent conclusion, based on the procedures we have performed 
and the evidence we have obtained; and
- Reporting our opinion to the Board of Directors of Novartis.
As we are engaged to form an independent conclusion on the Sustainability Information 
as prepared by management, we are not permitted to be involved in the preparation of 
the Sustainability Information as doing so may compromise our independence.
Professional Standards Applied
We performed a limited assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard 
on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) Assurance Engagements other than Audits 
or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, issued by the International Auditing and 
Assurance Standards Board and, in respect of the greenhouse gas emissions information 
included within the Sustainability Information, in accordance with International Standard on 
Assurance Engagements 3410 Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements, 
issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. 
Our Independence and Quality Control
We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Interna -
tional Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence 
Standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which is 
founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and 
due care, confidentiality, and professional behavior.
Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a 
comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures 
regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards, and applicable 
legal and regulatory requirements.
Our work was carried out by an independent and multidisciplinary team including assurance 
practitioners and sustainability experts. We remain solely responsible for our assurance 
conclusion.Summary of the Work we Performed as the Basis for our Assurance Conclusion
We are required to plan and perform our work to address the areas where we have identi -
fied that a material misstatement of the Sustainability Information is likely to arise. The 
procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment. Carrying out our 
limited assurance engagement on the Sustainability Information included, among others:
- Inquiries of employees responsible for the determination and consolidation, as well as the 
implementation of internal control procedures, regarding the Sustainability Information;
- Inspection of selected internal and external documents to determine whether qualitative 
and quantitative information is supported by sufficient evidence and presented in an accu -
rate and balanced manner;
- Assessment of the data collection, validation and reporting processes as well as the 
reliability of the reported data on a test basis and through testing of selected calculations;
- Analytical assessment of the data and trends of the Sustainability Information included in 
the scope of the limited assurance engagement;
- Considering the appropriateness of the carbon conversion factor calculations and other 
unit conversion factor calculations used by reference to widely recognised and estab -
lished conversion factors; and
- Reading the narrative within the Report with regard to the Reporting Criteria, and for 
consistency with our findings.
The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing 
from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, 
the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower 
than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable assur -
ance engagement.

United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that can generally be identified by words such as “potential,” “expected,” 
“will,” “planned,” “pipeline,” “outlook,” or similar expressions, or by express or implied discussions regarding potential new products, 
potential new indications for existing products, potential product launches, or regarding potential future revenues from any such products; 
regarding potential future sales or earnings of the Group or any of its divisions; or by discussions of strategy, plans, expectations or 
intentions; or regarding our intention to separate Sandoz by way of a 100% spin-off. Such forward-looking statements are based on the 
current beliefs and expectations of management regarding future events and are subject to significant known and unknown risks and 
uncertainties. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual 
results may vary materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on these 
statements. In particular, our expectations could be affected by, among other things: uncertainties regarding the success of key products 
and commercial priorities; global trends toward healthcare cost-containment, including ongoing government, payer and general public 
pricing and reimbursement pressures and requirements for increased pricing transparency; uncertainties in the research and development 
of new healthcare products, including clinical trial results and additional analysis of existing clinical data; our ability to obtain or maintain 
proprietary intellectual property protection, including the ultimate extent of the impact on Novartis of the loss of patent protection and 
exclusivity on key products that commenced in prior years and is expected to continue this year; the potential that the strategic benefits, 
operational efficiencies or opportunities expected from our recent transactions or our organizational transformation programs objectives, 
including the implementation of our new organizational structure, may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected; the 
potential that we may not be able to complete the planned 100% spin-off of Sandoz within the expected time frame, in the planned form, or 
at all; our performance on environmental, social and governance measures; uncertainties in the development or adoption of potentially 
transformational technologies and business models; uncertainties regarding potential significant breaches of information security or 
disruptions of our information technology systems; our reliance on outsourcing key business functions to third parties; our ability to attract, 
integrate and retain key personnel and qualified individuals; uncertainties regarding actual or potential legal proceedings, including, among 
others, litigation and other legal disputes with respect to our recent transactions, product liability litigation, litigation and investigations 
regarding sales and marketing practices, intellectual property disputes and government investigations generally; regulatory actions or 
delays or government regulation generally, including potential regulatory actions or delays with respect to the development of the products 
described in this Novartis in Society Integrated Report; our ability to comply with data privacy laws and regulations, and uncertainties 
regarding potential significant breaches of data privacy; safety, quality, data integrity or manufacturing issues; general political, economic 
and business conditions, including the effects of and efforts to mitigate pandemic diseases such as COVID-19; the impact of pandemic 
diseases such as COVID-19 on enrollment in, initiation and completion of our clinical trials in the future, and research and development 
timelines; uncertainties involved in predicting shareholder returns; uncertainties regarding the effects of recent and anticipated future 
changes in tax laws and their application to us; uncertainties regarding future global exchange rates; uncertainties regarding future 
demand for our products; and other risks and factors referred to in Novartis AG’s current Form 20-F on file with the US Securities and
